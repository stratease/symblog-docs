Creating a blog in Symfony2
===========================

Introduction
------------

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a full featured
blogging website using `Symfony2 <http://symfony.com/>`_. The Standard
Distribution of the Symfony2 framework will be used, which includes the main
components you will need when building your own websites. The tutorial is split
into a number of parts, each part covering different aspects of Symfony2 and its
components. This tutorial is aimed to be worked through similar to the
symfony 1 `Jobeet <http://www.symfony-project.org/jobeet/1_4/Doctrine/en/>`_
tutorial.

Symfony2 is highly customisable and provides a number of different ways to
perform the same task. Some examples of this include writing configuration
options in YAML, XML, PHP, or Annotation, and creating templates using Twig or
PHP. To keep this tutorial simple we will use YAML and Annotations for
configuration and Twig for templating. The
`Symfony book <http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/index.html>`_
provides a great resource for examples of how to use the other methods.
