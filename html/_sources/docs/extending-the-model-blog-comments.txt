[Part 4] - The Comments Model: Adding comments,  Doctrine Repositories and Migrations
=====================================================================================

Overview
--------

This chapter will build on the blog model we defined in the previous chapter. We
will create the comment model, which will handle comments for blog posts. We
will be introduced to creating relationships between models, as a blog post can
contain many comments. We will use the Doctrine 2 QueryBuilder and Doctrine 2
Repository classes to retrieve entities from the database. The concept of
Doctrine 2 Migrations will also be explored which provide a programmatic way to
deploy changes to the database. At the end of this chapter you will have created
the comment model and linked it together with the blog model. We will also have
created the homepage, and provided the ability for users to submit comments
for a blog post.


The Homepage
------------

We will begin this chapter by building the homepage. In true blogger fashion it will
display snippets of each blog post, ordered from newest to oldest. The full
blog post will be available via links to the blog show page. As we have already
built the route, controller and view for the homepage we can simply update these.

Retrieving the blogs: Querying the model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to display the blogs, we need to retrieve them from the database.
Doctrine 2 provides the
`Doctrine Query Language <http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/orm/2.1/en/reference/dql-doctrine-query-language.html>`_
(DQL) and a
`QueryBuilder <http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/orm/2.1/en/reference/query-builder.html>`_
to achieve this (You can also run raw SQL through Doctrine 2 but this method is
discouraged as it takes away the database abstraction Doctrine 2 gives us).
We will use the ``QueryBuilder`` as it provides a nice object oriented way for us to generate
DQL, which we can use to query the database. Let's update the ``index`` action of the ``Page`` controller
located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/PageController.php``
to pull the blogs from the database.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/PageController.php
    class PageController extends Controller
    {
        public function indexAction()
        {
            $em = $this->getDoctrine()
                       ->getManager();

            $blogs = $em->createQueryBuilder()
                        ->select('b')
                        ->from('BloggerBlogBundle:Blog',  'b')
                        ->addOrderBy('b.created', 'DESC')
                        ->getQuery()
                        ->getResult();

            return $this->render('BloggerBlogBundle:Page:index.html.twig', array(
                'blogs' => $blogs
            ));
        }

        // ..
    }

We begin by getting an instance of the ``QueryBuilder`` from the ``EntityManager``. This
allows us to start constructing the query using the many methods the ``QueryBuilder``
provides. The full list of available methods is available via the ``QueryBuilder``
documentation. A good place to start is with the
`helper methods <http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/orm/2.1/en/reference/query-builder.html#helper-methods>`_.
These are the methods we use, such as ``select()``, ``from()`` and ``addOrderBy()``.
As with previous interactions with Doctrine 2, we can use the short hand notation
to reference the ``Blog`` entity via ``BloggerBlogBundle:Blog`` (remember this
is the same as doing ``Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity\Blog``). When we have finished
specifying the criteria for the query, we call the ``getQuery()`` method which returns
a ``DQL`` instance. We are not able to get results from the ``QueryBuilder`` object, we must
always convert this to a ``DQL`` instance first. The ``DQL`` instance provides the ``getResult()``
method that returns a collection of ``Blog`` entities. We will see later that the ``DQL`` instance
has a
`number of methods <http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/orm/2.1/en/reference/dql-doctrine-query-language.html#query-result-formats>`_
for returning results including ``getSingleResult()`` and ``getArrayResult()``.

The View
........

Now we have a collection of ``Blog`` entities we need to display them.
Replace the content of the homepage template located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/index.html.twig``
with the following.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/index.html.twig #}
    {% extends 'BloggerBlogBundle::layout.html.twig' %}

    {% block body %}
        {% for blog in blogs %}
            <article class="blog">
                <div class="date"><time datetime="{{ blog.created|date('c') }}">{{ blog.created|date('l, F j, Y') }}</time></div>
                <header>
                    <h2><a href="{{ path('BloggerBlogBundle_blog_show', { 'id': blog.id }) }}">{{ blog.title }}</a></h2>
                </header>

                <img src="{{ asset(['images/', blog.image]|join) }}" />
                <div class="snippet">
                    <p>{{ blog.blog(500) }}</p>
                    <p class="continue"><a href="{{ path('BloggerBlogBundle_blog_show', { 'id': blog.id }) }}">Continue reading...</a></p>
                </div>

                <footer class="meta">
                    <p>Comments: -</p>
                    <p>Posted by <span class="highlight">{{blog.author}}</span> at {{ blog.created|date('h:iA') }}</p>
                    <p>Tags: <span class="highlight">{{ blog.tags }}</span></p>
                </footer>
            </article>
        {% else %}
            <p>There are no blog entries for symblog</p>
        {% endfor %}
    {% endblock %}

We introduce one of the Twig control structures here, the ``for..else..endfor``
structure. If you have not used a templating engine before you are probably
familiar with the following PHP snippet.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php if (count($blogs)): ?>
        <?php foreach ($blogs as $blog): ?>
            <h1><?php echo $blog->getTitle() ?><?h1>
            <!-- rest of content -->
        <?php endforeach ?>
    <?php else: ?>
        <p>There are no blog entries</p>
    <?php endif ?>

The Twig ``for..else..endfor`` control structure is a much cleaner way of
achieving this task. Most of the code within the homepage template is concerned with
outputting the blog information in HTML. However, there are a few things we need
to note. Firstly, we make use of the Twig ``path`` function to generate the
routes for the blog show page. As the blog show page requires a blog ``ID`` to
be present in the URL, we need to pass this as an argument into the ``path``
function. This can be seen with the following.

.. code-block:: html

    <h2><a href="{{ path('BloggerBlogBundle_blog_show', { 'id': blog.id }) }}">{{ blog.title }}</a></h2>

Secondly we output the blog content using ``<p>{{ blog.blog(500) }}</p>``.
The ``500`` argument we pass in, is the max length of the blog post we want to
receive back from the function. For this to work we need to update the
``getBlog`` method that Doctrine 2 generated for us previously. Update the
``getBlog`` method in the ``Blog`` entity located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php``.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php
    public function getBlog($length = null)
    {
        if (false === is_null($length) && $length > 0)
            return substr($this->blog, 0, $length);
        else
            return $this->blog;
    }

As the usual behavior of the ``getBlog`` method should be to return the entire blog
post, we set the ``$length`` parameter to have a default of ``null``. If ``null``
is passed in, the entire blog post is returned.

Now if you point your browser to ``http://symblog.dev/app_dev.php/`` you should
see the homepage displaying the latest blog post entries. You should also be able to navigate
to the full blog post for each entry by clicking the blog title or the
'continue reading...' link.

While we can query for entities in the controller, it is not the best place to.
The querying would be better placed outside of the controller for a number of reasons:

    1. We would be unable to reuse the query elsewhere in the application, without
       duplicating the ``QueryBuilder`` code.
    2. If we did duplicate the ``QueryBuilder`` code, we would have to make multiple
       modifications in the future if the query needed changing.
    3. Separating the query and the controller would allow us to test the query
       independently of the controller.

Doctrine 2 provides the Repository classes to facilitate this.

Doctrine 2 Repositories
-----------------------

We have already been introduced to the Doctrine 2 Repository classes in the previous
chapter when we created the blog show page. We used the default implementation of the
``Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository`` class to retrieve a blog entity from the
database via the ``find()`` method. As we want to create a custom query, we
need to create a custom repository. Doctrine 2 is able to assist in this task.
Update the ``Blog`` entity metadata located in the file at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php``.


.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php
    /**
     * @ORM\Entity(repositoryClass="Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity\Repository\BlogRepository")
     * @ORM\Table(name="blog")
     * @ORM\HasLifecycleCallbacks()
     */
    class Blog
    {
        // ..
    }

You can see we have specified the namespace location for the ``BlogRepository`` class
that this entity is associated with. As we have updated the Doctrine 2 metadata
for the ``Blog`` entity, we need to re-run the ``doctrine:generate:entities`` task
as follows.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console doctrine:generate:entities Blogger\BlogBundle

Doctrine 2 will have created the shell class for the ``BlogRepository`` located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Repository/BlogRepository.php``.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Repository/BlogRepository.php

    namespace Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity\Repository;

    use Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository;

    /**
     * BlogRepository
     *
     * This class was generated by the Doctrine ORM. Add your own custom
     * repository methods below.
     */
    class BlogRepository extends EntityRepository
    {

    }

The ``BlogRepository`` class extends the  ``EntityRepository``
class which provides the ``find()`` method we used earlier. Let's update the
``BlogRepository`` class, moving the ``QueryBuilder`` code from the ``Page``
controller into it.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Repository/BlogRepository.php

    namespace Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity\Repository;

    use Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository;

    /**
     * BlogRepository
     *
     * This class was generated by the Doctrine ORM. Add your own custom
     * repository methods below.
     */
    class BlogRepository extends EntityRepository
    {
        public function getLatestBlogs($limit = null)
        {
            $qb = $this->createQueryBuilder('b')
                       ->select('b')
                       ->addOrderBy('b.created', 'DESC');

            if (false === is_null($limit))
                $qb->setMaxResults($limit);

            return $qb->getQuery()
                      ->getResult();
        }
    }

We have created the method ``getLatestBlogs`` which will return the
latest blog entries, much in the same way the controller ``QueryBuilder`` code did.
In the repository class we have direct access to the ``QueryBuilder`` via the
``createQueryBuilder()`` method. We have also added a default ``$limit`` parameter
so we can limit the number of results to return. The result of the query
is much the same as it was in the controller. You may have noticed that we did not
need to specify the entity to use via the ``from()`` method. That's because we
are within the ``BlogRepository`` which is associated with the ``Blog`` entity.
If we look at the implementation of the ``createQueryBuilder`` method in the
``EntityRepository`` class we can see the ``from()`` method is called for us.

.. code-block:: php

    // Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository
    public function createQueryBuilder($alias)
    {
        return $this->_em->createQueryBuilder()
            ->select($alias)
            ->from($this->_entityName, $alias);
    }

Finally let's update the ``Page`` controller ``index`` action to use the ``BlogRepository``.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/PageController.php
    class PageController extends Controller
    {
        public function indexAction()
        {
            $em = $this->getDoctrine()
                       ->getManager();

            $blogs = $em->getRepository('BloggerBlogBundle:Blog')
                        ->getLatestBlogs();

            return $this->render('BloggerBlogBundle:Page:index.html.twig', array(
                'blogs' => $blogs
            ));
        }

        // ..
    }

Now when you refresh the homepage it should display exactly the same as before.
All we have done is refactored our code so the correct classes are performing
the correct tasks.

More on the Model: Creating the Comment Entity
----------------------------------------------

Blogs are only half the story when it comes to blogging. We also need to allow readers
the ability to comment on blog posts. These comments also need to be persisted, and linked
to the ``Blog`` entity as a blog can contain many comments.

We will start by defining the basics of the ``Comment`` Entity class.
Create a new file located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Comment.php`` and
paste in the following.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Comment.php

    namespace Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity;

    use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

    /**
     * @ORM\Entity(repositoryClass="Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity\Repository\CommentRepository")
     * @ORM\Table(name="comment")
     * @ORM\HasLifecycleCallbacks
     */
    class Comment
    {
        /**
         * @ORM\Id
         * @ORM\Column(type="integer")
         * @ORM\GeneratedValue(strategy="AUTO")
         */
        protected $id;

        /**
         * @ORM\Column(type="string")
         */
        protected $user;

        /**
         * @ORM\Column(type="text")
         */
        protected $comment;

        /**
         * @ORM\Column(type="boolean")
         */
        protected $approved;

        /**
         * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="Blog", inversedBy="comments")
         * @ORM\JoinColumn(name="blog_id", referencedColumnName="id")
         */
        protected $blog;

        /**
         * @ORM\Column(type="datetime")
         */
        protected $created;

        /**
         * @ORM\Column(type="datetime")
         */
        protected $updated;

        public function __construct()
        {
            $this->setCreated(new \DateTime());
            $this->setUpdated(new \DateTime());

            $this->setApproved(true);
        }

        /**
         * @ORM\preUpdate
         */
        public function setUpdatedValue()
        {
           $this->setUpdated(new \DateTime());
        }
    }

Most of what you see here, we have already covered in the previous chapter,
however we have used metadata to set up a link to the ``Blog`` entity. As a
comment is for a blog, we have setup a link in the ``Comment`` entity to
the ``Blog`` entity it belongs to. We do this by specify a ``ManyToOne`` link targeting the
``Blog`` entity. We also specify that the inverse of this link will be available
via ``comments``. To create this inverse, we need to update the ``Blog`` entity
so Doctrine 2 knows that a blog can contain many comments. Update the ``Blog``
entity located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php`` to add this mapping.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php

    namespace Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity;

    use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
    use Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection;

    /**
     * @ORM\Entity(repositoryClass="Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity\Repository\BlogRepository")
     * @ORM\Table(name="blog")
     * @ORM\HasLifecycleCallbacks
     */
    class Blog
    {
        // ..

        /**
         * @ORM\OneToMany(targetEntity="Comment", mappedBy="blog")
         */
        protected $comments;

        // ..

        public function __construct()
        {
            $this->comments = new ArrayCollection();

            $this->setCreated(new \DateTime());
            $this->setUpdated(new \DateTime());
        }

        // ..
    }

There are a few changes to point out here. First we add metadata to the ``$comments``
member. Remember in the previous chapter we didn't add any metadata for this member
because we didn't want Doctrine 2 to persist it. This is still true, however, we
do want Doctrine 2 to be able to populate this member with the relevant ``Comment``
entities. That is what the metadata achieves. Secondly, Doctrine 2 requires
that we default the ``$comments`` member to an ``ArrayCollection`` object.
We do this in the ``constructor``. Also, note the ``use`` statement to import the
``ArrayCollection`` class.

As we have now created the ``Comment`` entity, and updated the ``Blog`` entity,
let's get Doctrine 2 to generate the accessors. Run the following Doctrine 2
task as before to achieve this.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console doctrine:generate:entities Blogger\BlogBundle

Both entities should now be up-to-date with the correct accessor methods. You will
also notice the ``CommentRepository`` class has been created at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Repository/CommentRepository.php`` as we specified this in the
metadata.

Finally we need to update the database to reflect the changes to our entities. We
could use the ``doctrine:schema:update`` task as follows to do this, but instead
we will introduce Doctrine 2 Migrations.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console doctrine:schema:update --force

Doctrine 2 Migrations
-------------------

The Doctrine 2 Migrations extension and bundle do not come with the Symfony2 Standard
Distribution, we need to manually install them as we did with the Data Fixtures
extension and bundle. Open up the ``composer.json`` file located in the project root and add the
Doctrine 2 Migrations extension and bundle to it as follows.

.. code-block:: php

    "require": {
        // ...
        "doctrine/doctrine-migrations-bundle": "dev-master",
        "doctrine/migrations": "dev-master"
    }

Next update the vendors to reflect these changes.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php composer.phar update

This will pull down the latest version of each of the repositories from GitHub and
install them to the required locations.

Now let's register the bundle in the kernel located at ``app/AppKernel.php``.

.. code-block:: php

    // app/AppKernel.php
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...
            new Doctrine\Bundle\MigrationsBundle\DoctrineMigrationsBundle(),
            // ...
        );
        // ...
    }

We are now ready to update the database to reflect the entity changes. This
is a 2 step process. First we need to get Doctrine 2 Migrations to work out the differences
between the entities and the current database schema. This is done with the
``doctrine:migrations:diff`` task. Secondly we need to actually perform the migration
based on the previously created diff. This is done with the
``doctrine:migrations:migrate`` task.

Run the following 2 commands to update the database schema.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console doctrine:migrations:diff
    $ php app/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

Your database will now reflect the latest entity changes and contain the new
comment table.

.. note::

    You will also notice a new table in the database called ``migration_versions``.
    This stores the migration version numbers so the migration task is able to
    see what the current version of the database is.

.. tip::

    Doctrine 2 Migrations are a great way to update the production database as
    the changes can be done programatically. This means we can integrate this
    task into a deployment script so the database is updated automatically when
    we deploy a new release of the application. Doctrine 2 Migrations also allow
    us to roll back the changes as every created Migration has a ``up`` and ``down``
    method. To roll back to a previous version you need to specify the version number
    you would like to roll back to using the following task.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ php app/console doctrine:migrations:migrate 20110806183439

Data Fixtures: Revisited
-------------------------

Now we have the ``Comment`` entity created, let's add some fixtures for it.
It is always a good idea to add some fixtures each time you create an entity.
We know that a comment must have a related ``Blog`` entity set as it is setup
this way in the metadata, therefore when creating fixtures for ``Comment`` entities
we will need to specify the ``Blog`` entity. We have already created the fixtures
for the ``Blog`` entity so we could simply update this file to add the ``Comment``
entities. This may be manageable for now, but what happens when we later add users,
blog categories, and a whole load of other entities to our bundle? A better way
would be to create a new file for the ``Comment`` entity fixtures. The problem
with this approach is how do we access the ``Blog`` entities from the blog
fixtures.

Fortunately this can be achieved easily by setting references to objects in one
fixture file that other fixtures can access. Update the ``Blog`` entity
``DataFixtures`` located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/DataFixtures/ORM/BlogFixtures.php`` with the following.
The changes to note here are the extension of the ``AbstractFixture`` class and
the implementation of the ``OrderedFixtureInterface``. Also note the 2 new use
statements to import these classes.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/DataFixtures/ORM/BlogFixtures.php

    namespace Blogger\BlogBundle\DataFixtures\ORM;

    use Doctrine\Common\DataFixtures\AbstractFixture;
    use Doctrine\Common\DataFixtures\OrderedFixtureInterface;
    use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;
    use Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity\Blog;

    class BlogFixtures extends AbstractFixture implements OrderedFixtureInterface
    {
        public function load(ObjectManager $manager)
        {
            // ..

            $manager->flush();

            $this->addReference('blog-1', $blog1);
            $this->addReference('blog-2', $blog2);
            $this->addReference('blog-3', $blog3);
            $this->addReference('blog-4', $blog4);
            $this->addReference('blog-5', $blog5);
        }

        public function getOrder()
        {
            return 1;
        }
    }

We add references to the blog entities using the ``addReference()`` method.
This first parameter is a reference identifier we can use the retrieve the object
later. Finally we must implement the ``getOrder()`` method to specify the loading order
of the fixtures. Blogs must be loaded before comments so we return 1.

Comment Fixtures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are now ready to define some fixtures for our ``Comment`` entity. Create a fixtures file
at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/DataFixtures/ORM/CommentFixtures.php`` and add the
following content:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/DataFixtures/ORM/CommentFixtures.php

    namespace Blogger\BlogBundle\DataFixtures\ORM;

    use Doctrine\Common\DataFixtures\AbstractFixture;
    use Doctrine\Common\DataFixtures\OrderedFixtureInterface;
    use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;
    use Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity\Comment;
    use Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity\Blog;

    class CommentFixtures extends AbstractFixture implements OrderedFixtureInterface
    {
        public function load(ObjectManager $manager)
        {
            $comment = new Comment();
            $comment->setUser('symfony');
            $comment->setComment('To make a long story short. You can\'t go wrong by choosing Symfony! And no one has ever been fired for using Symfony.');
            $comment->setBlog($manager->merge($this->getReference('blog-1')));
            $manager->persist($comment);

            $comment = new Comment();
            $comment->setUser('David');
            $comment->setComment('To make a long story short. Choosing a framework must not be taken lightly; it is a long-term commitment. Make sure that you make the right selection!');
            $comment->setBlog($manager->merge($this->getReference('blog-1')));
            $manager->persist($comment);

            $comment = new Comment();
            $comment->setUser('Dade');
            $comment->setComment('Anything else, mom? You want me to mow the lawn? Oops! I forgot, New York, No grass.');
            $comment->setBlog($manager->merge($this->getReference('blog-2')));
            $manager->persist($comment);

            $comment = new Comment();
            $comment->setUser('Kate');
            $comment->setComment('Are you challenging me? ');
            $comment->setBlog($manager->merge($this->getReference('blog-2')));
            $comment->setCreated(new \DateTime("2011-07-23 06:15:20"));
            $manager->persist($comment);

            $comment = new Comment();
            $comment->setUser('Dade');
            $comment->setComment('Name your stakes.');
            $comment->setBlog($manager->merge($this->getReference('blog-2')));
            $comment->setCreated(new \DateTime("2011-07-23 06:18:35"));
            $manager->persist($comment);

            $comment = new Comment();
            $comment->setUser('Kate');
            $comment->setComment('If I win, you become my slave.');
            $comment->setBlog($manager->merge($this->getReference('blog-2')));
            $comment->setCreated(new \DateTime("2011-07-23 06:22:53"));
            $manager->persist($comment);

            $comment = new Comment();
            $comment->setUser('Dade');
            $comment->setComment('Your SLAVE?');
            $comment->setBlog($manager->merge($this->getReference('blog-2')));
            $comment->setCreated(new \DateTime("2011-07-23 06:25:15"));
            $manager->persist($comment);

            $comment = new Comment();
            $comment->setUser('Kate');
            $comment->setComment('You wish! You\'ll do shitwork, scan, crack copyrights...');
            $comment->setBlog($manager->merge($this->getReference('blog-2')));
            $comment->setCreated(new \DateTime("2011-07-23 06:46:08"));
            $manager->persist($comment);

            $comment = new Comment();
            $comment->setUser('Dade');
            $comment->setComment('And if I win?');
            $comment->setBlog($manager->merge($this->getReference('blog-2')));
            $comment->setCreated(new \DateTime("2011-07-23 10:22:46"));
            $manager->persist($comment);

            $comment = new Comment();
            $comment->setUser('Kate');
            $comment->setComment('Make it my first-born!');
            $comment->setBlog($manager->merge($this->getReference('blog-2')));
            $comment->setCreated(new \DateTime("2011-07-23 11:08:08"));
            $manager->persist($comment);

            $comment = new Comment();
            $comment->setUser('Dade');
            $comment->setComment('Make it our first-date!');
            $comment->setBlog($manager->merge($this->getReference('blog-2')));
            $comment->setCreated(new \DateTime("2011-07-24 18:56:01"));
            $manager->persist($comment);

            $comment = new Comment();
            $comment->setUser('Kate');
            $comment->setComment('I don\'t DO dates. But I don\'t lose either, so you\'re on!');
            $comment->setBlog($manager->merge($this->getReference('blog-2')));
            $comment->setCreated(new \DateTime("2011-07-25 22:28:42"));
            $manager->persist($comment);

            $comment = new Comment();
            $comment->setUser('Stanley');
            $comment->setComment('It\'s not gonna end like this.');
            $comment->setBlog($manager->merge($this->getReference('blog-3')));
            $manager->persist($comment);

            $comment = new Comment();
            $comment->setUser('Gabriel');
            $comment->setComment('Oh, come on, Stan. Not everything ends the way you think it should. Besides, audiences love happy endings.');
            $comment->setBlog($manager->merge($this->getReference('blog-3')));
            $manager->persist($comment);

            $comment = new Comment();
            $comment->setUser('Mile');
            $comment->setComment('Doesn\'t Bill Gates have something like that?');
            $comment->setBlog($manager->merge($this->getReference('blog-5')));
            $manager->persist($comment);

            $comment = new Comment();
            $comment->setUser('Gary');
            $comment->setComment('Bill Who?');
            $comment->setBlog($manager->merge($this->getReference('blog-5')));
            $manager->persist($comment);

            $manager->flush();
        }

        public function getOrder()
        {
            return 2;
        }
    }

As with the modifications we made the ``BlogFixtures`` class, the ``CommentFixtures``
class also extends the ``AbstractFixture`` class and  implements the ``OrderedFixtureInterface``.
This means we must also implement the ``getOrder()`` method. This time we set the
return value to 2, ensuring these fixtures will be loaded after the blog fixtures.

We can also see how the references to the ``Blog`` entities we created earlier
are being used.

.. code-block:: php

    $comment->setBlog($manager->merge($this->getReference('blog-2')));

We are now ready to load the fixtures into the database.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console doctrine:fixtures:load

Displaying Comments
-------------------

We can now display the comments related to each blog post. We begin by
updating the ``CommentRepository`` with a method to retrieve the latest approved
comments for a blog post.

Comment Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open the ``CommentRepository`` class located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Repository/CommentRepository.php`` and replace its
content with the following.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Repository/CommentRepository.php

    namespace Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity\Repository;

    use Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository;

    /**
     * CommentRepository
     *
     * This class was generated by the Doctrine ORM. Add your own custom
     * repository methods below.
     */
    class CommentRepository extends EntityRepository
    {
        public function getCommentsForBlog($blogId, $approved = true)
        {
            $qb = $this->createQueryBuilder('c')
                       ->select('c')
                       ->where('c.blog = :blog_id')
                       ->addOrderBy('c.created')
                       ->setParameter('blog_id', $blogId);

            if (false === is_null($approved))
                $qb->andWhere('c.approved = :approved')
                   ->setParameter('approved', $approved);

            return $qb->getQuery()
                      ->getResult();
        }
    }

The method we have created will retrieve comments for a blog post. To do this
we need to add a where clause to our query. The where clause uses a named parameter
that is set using the ``setParameter()`` method. You should always use parameters
instead of setting the values directly in the query like so

.. code-block:: php

    ->where('c.blog = ' . blogId)

In this example the value of ``$blogId`` will not be sanitized and could leave the
query open to an `SQL injection <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection>`_ attack.

Blog Controller
---------------

Next we need to update the ``show`` action of the ``Blog`` controller to retrieve
the comments for the blog. Update the ``Blog`` controller located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/BlogController.php`` with the following.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/BlogController.php

    public function showAction($id)
    {
        // ..

        if (!$blog) {
            throw $this->createNotFoundException('Unable to find Blog post.');
        }

        $comments = $em->getRepository('BloggerBlogBundle:Comment')
                       ->getCommentsForBlog($blog->getId());

        return $this->render('BloggerBlogBundle:Blog:show.html.twig', array(
            'blog'      => $blog,
            'comments'  => $comments
        ));
    }

We use the new method on the ``CommentRepository`` to retrieve the approved comments
for the blog. The ``$comments`` collection is also passed into the template.

Blog show template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we have a list of comments for the blog we can update the blog show template
to display the comments. We could simply place the rendering of the comments
directly in the blog show template, but as comments are their own entity, it would
be better to separate the rendering into another template, and include that
template. This would allow us to reuse the comment rendering template elsewhere in the
application. Update the blog show template located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Blog/show.html.twig`` with the
following.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Blog/show.html.twig #}

    {# .. #}

    {% block body %}
        {# .. #}

        <section class="comments" id="comments">
            <section class="previous-comments">
                <h3>Comments</h3>
                {% include 'BloggerBlogBundle:Comment:index.html.twig' with { 'comments': comments } %}
            </section>
        </section>
    {% endblock %}

You can see the use of a new Twig tag, the ``include`` tag. This will include the
content of the template specified by ``BloggerBlogBundle:Comment:index.html.twig``.
We can also pass over any number of arguments to the template. In this case, we need
to pass over a collection of ``Comment`` entities to render.

Comment show template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``BloggerBlogBundle:Comment:index.html.twig`` we are including above does
not exist yet so we need to create it. As this is just a template, we don't need
to create a route or a controller for this, we only need the template file. Create
a new file located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Comment/index.html.twig``
and paste in the following.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Comment/index.html.twig #}

    {% for comment in comments %}
        <article class="comment {{ cycle(['odd', 'even'], loop.index0) }}" id="comment-{{ comment.id }}">
            <header>
                <p><span class="highlight">{{ comment.user }}</span> commented <time datetime="{{ comment.created|date('c') }}">{{ comment.created|date('l, F j, Y') }}</time></p>
            </header>
            <p>{{ comment.comment }}</p>
        </article>
    {% else %}
        <p>There are no comments for this post. Be the first to comment...</p>
    {% endfor %}

As you can see we iterate over a collection of ``Comment`` entities and display
the comments. We also introduce one of the other nice Twig functions, the ``cycle``
function. This function will cycle through the values in the array you
pass it as each iteration of the loop progresses. The current loop iteration value
is obtained via the special ``loop.index0`` variable. This keeps a count of the
loop iterations, starting at 0. There are a number of other
`special variables <http://www.twig-project.org/doc/templates.html#for>`_
available when we are within a loop code block. You may also notice the setting
of an HTML ID to the ``article`` element. This will allow us to later create
permalinks to created comments.

Comment show CSS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally let's add some CSS to keep the comments looking stylish. Update the stylesheet
located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resorces/public/css/blog.css`` with the following.

.. code-block:: css

    /** src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resorces/public/css/blog.css **/
    .comments { clear: both; }
    .comments .odd { background: #eee; }
    .comments .comment { padding: 20px; }
    .comments .comment p { margin-bottom: 0; }
    .comments h3 { background: #eee; padding: 10px; font-size: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; clear: both; }
    .comments .previous-comments { margin-bottom: 20px; }

.. note::

    If you are not using the symlink method for referencing bundle assets into the
    ``web`` folder you must re-run the assets install task now to copy over the
    changes to your CSS.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ php app/console assets:install web

If you now have a look at one of the blog show pages, e.g.
``http://symblog.dev/app_dev.php/2`` you should see the blog comments output.

.. image:: /_static/images/part_4/comments.jpg
    :align: center
    :alt: symblog show blog comments

Adding Comments
---------------

The last part of this chapter will add the functionality for users to add
comments to a blog post. This will be possible via a form on the blog show page. We
have already been introduced to creating forms in Symfony2 when we created the
contact form. Rather than creating the comment form manually, we can use Symfony2
to do this for us. Run the following task to generate the ``CommentType`` class for
the ``Comment`` entity.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console generate:doctrine:form BloggerBlogBundle:Comment

You'll notice again here, the use of the short hand version to specify the
``Comment`` entity.

.. tip::

    You may have noticed the task ``doctrine:generate:form`` is also available.
    This is the same task just namespaced differently.

The generate form task has created the ``CommentType`` class located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Form/CommentType.php``.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Form/CommentType.php

    namespace Blogger\BlogBundle\Form;

    use Symfony\Component\Form\AbstractType;
    use Symfony\Component\Form\FormBuilder;

    class CommentType extends AbstractType
    {
        public function buildForm(FormBuilder $builder, array $options)
        {
            $builder
                ->add('user')
                ->add('comment')
                ->add('approved')
                ->add('created')
                ->add('updated')
                ->add('blog')
            ;
        }

        public function getName()
        {
            return 'blogger_blogbundle_commenttype';
        }
    }

We have already explored what is happening here in the previous ``EnquiryType``
class. We could begin by customising this class now, but let's move onto displaying
the form first.

Displaying the Comment Form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As we want the user to add comments from the show blog page, we could create the
form in the ``show`` action of the ``Blog`` controller and render the form
directly in the ``show`` template. However, it would be better to separate this
code as we did with displaying the comments. The difference between showing
the comments and displaying the comment form is the comment form needs
processing, so this time a controller is required. This introduces a method
slightly different to the above where we just included a template.

Routing
~~~~~~~

We need to create a new route to handle the processing of submitted forms. Add
a new route to  the routing file located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    BloggerBlogBundle_comment_create:
        pattern:  /comment/{blog_id}
        defaults: { _controller: BloggerBlogBundle:Comment:create }
        requirements:
            _method:  POST
            blog_id: \d+

The controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, we need to create the new ``Comment`` controller we have referenced above.
Create a file located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/CommentController.php`` and
paste in the following.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/CommentController.php

    namespace Blogger\BlogBundle\Controller;

    use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;
    use Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity\Comment;
    use Blogger\BlogBundle\Form\CommentType;

    /**
     * Comment controller.
     */
    class CommentController extends Controller
    {
        public function newAction($blog_id)
        {
            $blog = $this->getBlog($blog_id);

            $comment = new Comment();
            $comment->setBlog($blog);
            $form   = $this->createForm(new CommentType(), $comment);

            return $this->render('BloggerBlogBundle:Comment:form.html.twig', array(
                'comment' => $comment,
                'form'   => $form->createView()
            ));
        }

        public function createAction($blog_id)
        {
            $blog = $this->getBlog($blog_id);

            $comment  = new Comment();
            $comment->setBlog($blog);
            $request = $this->getRequest();
            $form    = $this->createForm(new CommentType(), $comment);
            $form->bindRequest($request);

            if ($form->isValid()) {
                // TODO: Persist the comment entity

                return $this->redirect($this->generateUrl('BloggerBlogBundle_blog_show', array(
                    'id' => $comment->getBlog()->getId())) .
                    '#comment-' . $comment->getId()
                );
            }

            return $this->render('BloggerBlogBundle:Comment:create.html.twig', array(
                'comment' => $comment,
                'form'    => $form->createView()
            ));
        }

        protected function getBlog($blog_id)
        {
            $em = $this->getDoctrine()
                        ->getManager();

            $blog = $em->getRepository('BloggerBlogBundle:Blog')->find($blog_id);

            if (!$blog) {
                throw $this->createNotFoundException('Unable to find Blog post.');
            }

            return $blog;
        }

    }

We create 2 actions in the ``Comment`` controller, one for ``new`` and one for
``create``. The ``new`` action is concerned with displaying the comment form,
the ``create`` action is concerned with processing the submission of the comment
form. While this may seem like a big chuck of code, there is nothing new here,
everything was covered in chapter 2 when we created the contact form. However,
before moving on make sure you fully understand what is happening in the
``Comment`` controller.

Form Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We don't want users to be able to submit blog comments with blank ``user`` or
``comment`` values. To achieve this we look back to the validators we were
introduced to in part 2 when creating the enquiry form. Update the ``Comment``
entity located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Comment.php`` with the
following.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Comment.php

    // ..

    use Symfony\Component\Validator\Mapping\ClassMetadata;
    use Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraints\NotBlank;

    // ..
    class Comment
    {
        // ..

        public static function loadValidatorMetadata(ClassMetadata $metadata)
        {
            $metadata->addPropertyConstraint('user', new NotBlank(array(
                'message' => 'You must enter your name'
            )));
            $metadata->addPropertyConstraint('comment', new NotBlank(array(
                'message' => 'You must enter a comment'
            )));
        }

        // ..
    }

The constraints ensure that both the user and comment members must not be blank.
We have also set the ``message`` option for both constraints to override the
default ones. Remember to add the namespace for ``ClassMetadata`` and
``NotBlank`` as shown above.

The view
~~~~~~~~

Next we need to create the 2 templates for the ``new`` and ``create`` controller
actions. First create  a new file
located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Comment/form.html.twig``
and paste in the following.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Comment/form.html.twig #}

    <form action="{{ path('BloggerBlogBundle_comment_create', { 'blog_id' : comment.blog.id } ) }}" method="post" {{ form_enctype(form) }} class="blogger">
        {{ form_widget(form) }}
        <p>
            <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </p>
    </form>

The purpose of this template is simple, it just renders the comment form. You'll
also notice the ``action`` of the form is to ``POST`` to the new route we created
``BloggerBlogBundle_comment_create``.

Next let's add the template for the ``create`` view. Create a new file located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Comment/create.html.twig``
and paste in the following.

.. code-block:: html

    {% extends 'BloggerBlogBundle::layout.html.twig' %}

    {% block title %}Add Comment{% endblock%}

    {% block body %}
        <h1>Add comment for blog post "{{ comment.blog.title }}"</h1>
        {% include 'BloggerBlogBundle:Comment:form.html.twig' with { 'form': form } %}
    {% endblock %}

As the ``create`` action of the ``Comment`` controller deals with processing
the form, it also needs to be able to display it, as there could be errors in the
form. We reuse the ``BloggerBlogBundle:Comment:form.html.twig`` to render the
actual form to prevent code duplication.

Now let's update the blog show template to render the add blog form. Update the
template located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Blog/show.html.twig``
with the following.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Blog/show.html.twig #}

    {# .. #}

    {% block body %}

        {# .. #}

        <section class="comments" id="comments">
            {# .. #}

            <h3>Add Comment</h3>
            {{ render(controller('BloggerBlogBundle:Comment:new', { 'blog_id': blog.id } )) }}
        </section>
    {% endblock %}

We use another new Twig tag here, the ``render`` tag. This tag will render
the contents of a controller into the template. In our case we render the
contents of the ``BloggerBlogBundle:Comment:new`` controller action.

If you now have a look at one of the blog show pages, such as
``http://symblog.dev/app_dev.php/2`` you'll notice a Symfony2 exception is thrown.

This exception is being thrown by the ``BloggerBlogBundle:Blog:show.html.twig``
template. If we look at line 25 of the ``BloggerBlogBundle:Blog:show.html.twig``
template we can see it's the following line showing that the problem actually exists
in the process of embedding the ``BloggerBlogBundle:Comment:create`` controller.

.. code-block:: html

    {% render 'BloggerBlogBundle:Comment:create' with { 'blog_id': blog.id } %}

If we look at the exception message further it gives us some more information
about the nature of why the exception was caused.

    Entities passed to the choice field must have a "__toString()" method defined

This is telling us that a choice field that we are trying to render doesn't have
a ``__toString()`` method set for the entity the choice field is associated with.
A choice field is a form element that gives the user a number of choices,
such as a ``select`` (drop down) element. You may be wondering where are we rendering
a choice field in the comment form? If you look at the comment form template again you will notice
we render the form using the ``{{ form_widget(form) }}`` Twig function. This
function outputs the entire form in its basic form. So let's go back to the class
the form is created from, the ``CommentType`` class. We can see that a number of
fields are being added to the form via the ``FormBuilder`` object. In particular
we are adding a ``blog`` field.

If you remember from chapter 2, we spoke about how the ``FormBuilder`` will try
to guess the field type to output based on metadata related to the field. As we
setup a relationship between ``Comment`` and ``Blog`` entities, the
``FormBuilder`` has guessed the comment should be a ``choice`` field, which
would allow the user to specify the blog post to attach the comment to. That is
why we have a ``choice`` field in the form, and why the Symfony2 exception is
being thrown. We can fix this problem by implementing the ``__toString()``
method in the ``Blog`` entity.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php
    public function __toString()
    {
        return $this->getTitle();
    }

.. tip::

    The Symfony2 error messages are very informative when describing the problem
    that has occurred. Always read the error messages as they will usually make
    the debugging process a lot easier. The error messages also provide a full
    stack trace so you can see the steps that were taken to cause the error.

Now when you refresh the page you should see the comment form output. You will
also notice that some undesirable fields have been output such as ``approved``,
``created``, ``updated`` and ``blog``. This is because we did not customise
the generated ``CommentType`` class earlier.

.. tip::

    The fields being rendered all seem to be output as the correct type of fields.
    The ``user`` fields is an ``text`` field, the ``comment`` field is a ``textarea``,
    the 2 ``DateTime`` fields are a number of ``select`` fields allowing us to specify the
    time, etc.

    This is because of the ability of ``FormBuilder`` to guess the type of field
    the member it is rendering requires. It is able to do this based on the metadata
    you provide. As we have specified quite specific metadata for the ``Comment``
    entity, the ``FormBuilder`` is able to make accurate guesses of the field types.

Let's now update this class located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Form/CommentType.php`` to output only the fields we
need.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Form/CommentType.php

    // ..
    class CommentType extends AbstractType
    {
        public function buildForm(FormBuilder $builder, array $options)
        {
            $builder
                ->add('user')
                ->add('comment')
            ;
        }

        // ..
    }

Now when you refresh the page only the user and comment fields are output. If
you were to submit the form now, the comment would not actually be saved to the
database. That's because the form controller does nothing with the ``Comment`` entity
if the form passes validation. So how do we persist the ``Comment`` entity to the database?
You have already seen how to do this when creating ``DataFixtures``. Update the
``create`` action of the ``Comment`` controller to persist the ``Comment`` entity
to the database.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/CommentController.php

    // ..
    class CommentController extends Controller
    {
        public function createAction($blog_id)
        {
            // ..

            if ($form->isValid()) {
                $em = $this->getDoctrine()
                           ->getManager();
                $em->persist($comment);
                $em->flush();

                return $this->redirect($this->generateUrl('BloggerBlogBundle_blog_show', array(
                    'id' => $comment->getBlog()->getId())) .
                    '#comment-' . $comment->getId()
                );
            }

            // ..
        }
    }

Persisting the ``Comment`` entity is as simple as a call to ``persist()`` and ``flush()``.
Remember, the form just deals with PHP objects, and Doctrine 2 manages and persists
these objects. There is no direct connection between submitting a form, and
the submitted data being persisted to the database.

You should now be able to add comments to the blog posts.

Conclusion
----------

We have made good progress in this chapter. Our blogging website is starting to
function more like you'd expect. We now have the basics of the homepage created
and the comment entity. Users can now post comments on blogs and read comments
left by other user. We saw how to create fixtures that could be referenced
across multiple fixture files and used Doctrine 2 Migrations to keep the database
schema inline with the entity changes.

Next we will look at building the sidebar to include The Tag Cloud and Recent
Comments. We will also extend Twig by creating our own custom filters. Finally
we will look at using the Assetic asset library to assist us in managing our
assets.
