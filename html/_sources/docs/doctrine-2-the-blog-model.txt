[Part 3] - The Blog Model: Using Doctrine 2 and Data Fixtures
=============================================================

Overview
--------

This chapter will begin to explore the blog model. The model will be implemented
using the `Doctrine 2 <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm>`_ Object
Relation Mapper (ORM). Doctrine 2 provides us with persistence for our PHP
objects. It also provides a proprietary SQL dialect
called the Doctrine Query Language (DQL). In addition to Doctrine 2, we will also be
introduced to the concept of Data Fixtures. Data fixtures are a
mechanism to populate our development and testing databases with suitable test
data. At the end of this chapter you will have defined the blog model, updated
the database to reflect the new model, and created some data fixtures. You will
also have built the basics of the show blog page.

Doctrine 2: The Model
---------------------

For our blog to function we need a way to persist data. Doctrine 2 provides
an ORM library designed exactly for this purpose. The Doctrine 2 ORM sits on top of a
powerful
`Database Abstraction Layer <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/dbal>`_
that gives us storage abstraction via the PHP PDO. This allows us to use a number
of different storage engines including MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite. We will
use MySQL for our storage engine, but any other engine could easily be
substituted.

.. tip::

    If you are not familiar with ORMs, we will explain the basic principle of them.
    The definition from
    `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping>`_ reads:

    "Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping) in computer software
    is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type
    systems in object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a
    "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming
    language."

    What the ORM facilitates is translating the data from a relational database
    such as MySQL into PHP objects that we can manipulate. This allows us to
    encapsuate the functionality we require on a table within a class. Think of a
    user table, it probably has fields like username, password, first_name,
    last_name, email and dob. With an ORM this becomes a class with members username,
    password, first_name, etc which allows us to call methods such as ``getUsername()`` and
    ``setPassword()``. ORMs go much further than this though, they are also able to
    retrieve related tables for us, either at the same time as we retrieve the user object, or
    lazily later on. Now consider our user has some friends related to it. This would
    be a friends table, storing the primary key of the user table within it. Using
    the ORM we could now make a call such as ``$user->getFriends()`` to retrieve objects
    of the friends table. If that's not enough, the ORM also deals with persitence
    so we can create objects in PHP, call a method such as ``save()`` and let the ORM
    deal with the details of actually persisting the data to the database. As we are
    using the Doctrine 2 ORM library, you will become much more familiar with
    what an ORM is as we progress through this tutorial.

.. note::

    While this tutorial will use the Doctrine 2 ORM library, you could opt to use
    the Doctrine 2 Object Document Mapper (ODM) library. There are a number of
    variations of this library including implementations for
    `MongoDB <http://www.mongodb.org/>`_ and
    `CouchDB <http://couchdb.apache.org/>`_.
    See the `Doctrine Projects <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects>`_
    page for more information.

    There is also a
    `cookbook <http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/doctrine/mongodb.html>`_
    article that explains how to setup ODM with Symfony2.

The Blog Entity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will begin by creating the ``Blog`` entity class. We have already been introduced to
entities in the previous chapter when we created the ``Enquiry`` entity.
As the purpose of an entity is to hold data, it makes perfect sense to use
one to represent a blog entry. By defining an entity we are not automatically
saying the data will be mapped to the database. We saw this with our ``Enquiry``
entity where the data held in the entity was just emailed to the webmaster.

Create a new file located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php`` and
paste in the following.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php

    namespace Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity;

    class Blog
    {
        protected $title;

        protected $author;

        protected $blog;

        protected $image;

        protected $tags;

        protected $comments;

        protected $created;

        protected $updated;
    }


As you can see this is simple PHP class. It extends no parent and has no
accessors. Each of the members is declared as protected so we are unable to
access them when operating on an object of this class. We could declare the
getters and setters for these attributes ourself, but Doctrine 2 provides a
task to do this. After all, writing accessors is not the most exhilarating of
coding tasks.

Before we can run this task, we need to inform Doctrine 2 how the ``Blog``
entity should be mapped to the database. The information is specified as metadata
using Doctrine 2 mappings. The metadata can be specified in and number of formats
including ``YAML``, ``PHP``, ``XML`` and ``Annotations``. We will use
``Annotations`` in this tutorial. It is important to note that not all members
in the entity need to be persisted, so we won't provide metadata for these.
This gives us the flexibility to choose only the members we require Doctrine 2 to
map to the database. Replace the content of the ``Blog`` entity class located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php`` with the following.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php

    namespace Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity;

    use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

    /**
     * @ORM\Entity
     * @ORM\Table(name="blog")
     */
    class Blog
    {
        /**
         * @ORM\Id
         * @ORM\Column(type="integer")
         * @ORM\GeneratedValue(strategy="AUTO")
         */
        protected $id;

        /**
         * @ORM\Column(type="string")
         */
        protected $title;

        /**
         * @ORM\Column(type="string", length=100)
         */
        protected $author;

        /**
         * @ORM\Column(type="text")
         */
        protected $blog;

        /**
         * @ORM\Column(type="string", length=20)
         */
        protected $image;

        /**
         * @ORM\Column(type="text")
         */
        protected $tags;

        protected $comments;

        /**
         * @ORM\Column(type="datetime")
         */
        protected $created;

        /**
         * @ORM\Column(type="datetime")
         */
        protected $updated;
    }


First we import and alias the Doctrine 2 ORM Mappings namespace. This allows
us to use ``annotations`` to describe the metadata for the entity. The
metadata provides information on how the members should be mapped to the
database.

.. tip::

    We have only used a small subset of the provided Doctrine 2 mapping types.
    A full list of
    `mapping types <http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/orm/2.0/en/reference/basic-mapping.html#doctrine-mapping-types>`_
    can be found on the Doctrine 2 website. Other mapping types will
    be introduced later in the tutorial.

The keen eyed among you may have noticed that the ``$comments`` member has no
metadata attached. This is because we don't need this persisted, it will just
provide a collection of comments related to a blog post. If you think of this without
the database in mind it makes sense. The following code snippets will demonstrate this.

.. code-block:: php

    // Create a blog object.
    $blog = new Blog();
    $blog->setTitle("symblog - A Symfony2 Tutorial");
    $blog->setAuthor("dsyph3r");
    $blog->setBlog("symblog is a fully featured blogging website ...");

    // Create a comment and add it to our blog
    $comment = new Comment();
    $comment->setComment("Symfony2 rocks!");
    $blog->addComment($comment);

The above snippet demonstrates the normal behavior you'd want from a blog
and comment class. Internally the ``$blog->addComment()`` method could be implemented
as follows.

.. code-block:: php

    class Blog
    {
        protected $comments = array();

        public function addComment(Comment $comment)
        {
            $this->comments[] = $comment;
        }
    }

The ``addComment`` method just adds a new comment object to the blog's ``$comments``
member. Retrieving the comments would also be simple.

.. code-block:: php

    class Blog
    {
        protected $comments = array();

        public function getComments()
        {
            return $this->comments;
        }
    }

As you can see the ``$comments`` member is just a list of ``Comment`` objects.
Doctrine 2 doesn't change how this works. Doctrine 2 will be able to automatically
populate this ``$comments`` member with objects related to the ``blog`` object.

Now that we have told Doctrine 2 how to map the entity members, we can generate
the accessor methods using the following.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console doctrine:generate:entities Blogger


You will notice the ``Blog`` Entity has been updated with accessor methods. Each time
we make a change to the ORM metadata for our entity classes we can run this to generate
any additional acccessors. This command will not make amendments to accessors that
already existing in the entity, so your existing accessor methods will never be overridden
by this command. This is important as you may later customise some of the default
accessors.

.. tip::

    While we have used ``annotations`` in our entity, it is possible to convert
    the mapping information into the other supported mapping formats using the
    ``doctrine:mapping:convert`` task. For example, the following command will
    convert the mappings in the above entity into the ``yaml`` format.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ php app/console doctrine:mapping:convert --namespace="Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity\Blog" yaml src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/config/doctrine

    This will create a file located at
    ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/config/doctrine/Blogger.BlogBundle.Entity.Blog.orm.yml``
    that will contain the ``blog`` entity mappings in ``yaml`` format.

The database
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating the database
.....................

If you followed along in chapter 1 of the tutorial, you should have
used the web configurator to set the database settings. If you didn't, update the
``database_*`` options in the parameters file located at ``app/config/parameters.ini``.

It's now time to create the database using another Doctrine 2 task. This task only
creates the database, it does not create any tables inside the database.
If a database with the same name already exists the task will throw an error and
the existing database will be left intact.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console doctrine:database:create

We are now ready to create the ``Blog`` entity representation in the database.
There are 2 ways we can achieve this. We can use the Doctrine 2 schema
tasks to update the database or we can use the more powerful Doctrine 2
migrations. For now we will use the schema task. Doctrine Migrations will
be introduced in the following chapter.

Creating the blog table
.......................

To create the blog table in our database we can run the following
doctrine task.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console doctrine:schema:create

This will execute the SQL needed to generate the database schema for the ``blog``
entity. You can also pass in the ``--dump-sql`` option for the task to dump
out the SQL instead of executing it against the database. If you view your
database you will see the blog table has been created, with the fields we
setup mapping information for.

.. tip::

    We have used a number of the Symfony2 command line task now, and in true
    command line task format they all provide help by specifying the ``--help``
    option. To see the help details for the ``doctrine:schema:create`` task,
    run the following

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ php app/console doctrine:schema:create --help

    The help information will be output showing the usage, and available
    options. Most tasks come with a number of options that can be set to
    customise the running of the task.

Integrating the Model with the View. Showing a blog entry
---------------------------------------------------------

Now we have the ``Blog`` entity created, and the database updated to reflect this,
we can start integrating the model into the view. We will start by building the
show page of our blog.

The Show Blog Route
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We begin by creating a route for the blog ``show`` action. A blog will be identified
by its unique ID, so this ID will need to be present in the URL. Update the
``BloggerBlogBundle`` routing located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml``
with the following

.. code-block:: yaml

    # src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml
    BloggerBlogBundle_blog_show:
        pattern:  /{id}
        defaults: { _controller: BloggerBlogBundle:Blog:show }
        requirements:
            _method:  GET
            id: \d+

As the blog ID must be present in the URL, we have specified an ``id`` placeholder.
This means URLs like ``http://symblog.co.uk/1`` and ``http://symblog.co.uk/my-blog``
will match this route. However, we know the blog ID must be a integer (it's defined this
way in the entity mappings) so we can add a constraint that specifies this route
only matches when the ``id`` parameter contains an integer. This is achieved with the
``id: \d+`` route requirement. Now only the first URL example of the previous would match,
``http://symblog.co.uk/my-blog`` would no longer match this route. You can also
see a matching route will execute the ``show`` action of the ``BloggerBlogBundle``
``Blog`` controller. This controller is yet to be created.

The Show Controller Action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The glue between the Model and the View is the controller, so this is where we
will begin creating the show page. We could add the ``show`` action to our existing
``Page`` controller but as this page is concerned with showing ``blog`` entities
it would be better suited in its own ``Blog`` controller.

Create a new file located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/BlogController.php``
and paste in the following.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/BlogController.php

    namespace Blogger\BlogBundle\Controller;

    use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;

    /**
     * Blog controller.
     */
    class BlogController extends Controller
    {
        /**
         * Show a blog entry
         */
        public function showAction($id)
        {
            $em = $this->getDoctrine()->getManager();

            $blog = $em->getRepository('BloggerBlogBundle:Blog')->find($id);

            if (!$blog) {
                throw $this->createNotFoundException('Unable to find Blog post.');
            }

            return $this->render('BloggerBlogBundle:Blog:show.html.twig', array(
                'blog'      => $blog,
            ));
        }
    }

We have created a new Controller for the ``Blog`` entity and defined the ``show`` action.
As we specified a ``id`` parameter in the ``BloggerBlogBundle_blog_show`` routing
rule, it will be passed in as an argument to the ``showAction`` method. If we had specified
more parameters in the routing rule, they would also be passed in as separate arguments.

.. tip::

    The controller actions will also pass over an object of
    ``Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request`` if you specify this as a parameter.
    This can be useful when dealing with forms. We have already used a form
    in chapter 2, but we did not use this method as we used one of the
    ``Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller`` helper methods as follows.

    .. code-block:: php

        // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/PageController.php
        public function contactAction()
        {
            // ..
            $request = $this->getRequest();
        }

    We could have instead written this as follows.

    .. code-block:: php

        // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/PageController.php

        use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

        public function contactAction(Request $request)
        {
            // ..
        }

    Both methods achieve the same task. If your controller did not extend the
    ``Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller`` helper class
    you would not be able to use the first method.

Next we need to retrieve the ``Blog`` entity from the database. We first
use another helper method of the ``Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller``
class to get the Doctrine2 Entity Manager. The job of the
`Entity Manager <http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/orm/2.0/en/reference/working-with-objects.html>`_
is to handle the retrieval and persistence of objects to and from the database. We
then use the ``EntityManager`` object to get the Doctrine2 ``Repository`` for the
``BloggerBlogBundle:Blog`` entity. The syntax specified here is simply
a short cut that can be used with Doctrine 2 instead of specifying the full
entity name, i.e. ``Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity\Blog``. With the repository object
we call the ``find()`` method passing in the ``$id`` argument.
This method will retrieve the object by its primary key.

Finally we check that an entity was found, and pass this entity over to the view.
If no entity was found a ``createNotFoundException`` is thrown. This will
ultimately generate a ``404 Not Found`` response.

.. tip::

    The repository object gives you access to a number of useful helper methods
    including

    .. code-block:: php

        // Return entities where 'author' matches 'dsyph3r'
        $em->getRepository('BloggerBlogBundle:Blog')->findBy(array('author' => 'dsyph3r'));

        // Return one entity where 'slug' matches 'symblog-tutorial'
        $em->getRepository('BloggerBlogBundle:Blog')->findOneBySlug('symblog-tutorial');

    We will create our own custom Repository classes in the next chapter
    when we require more complex queries.

The View
~~~~~~~~

Now we have built the ``show`` action for the ``Blog`` controller we can focus
on displaying the ``Blog`` entity. As specified in the ``show`` action the
template ``BloggerBlogBundle:Blog:show.html.twig`` will be rendered. Let's create
this template located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resouces/views/Blog/show.html.twig``
and paste in the following.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resouces/views/Blog/show.html.twig #}
    {% extends 'BloggerBlogBundle::layout.html.twig' %}

    {% block title %}{{ blog.title }}{% endblock %}

    {% block body %}
        <article class="blog">
            <header>
                <div class="date"><time datetime="{{ blog.created|date('c') }}">{{ blog.created|date('l, F j, Y') }}</time></div>
                <h2>{{ blog.title }}</h2>
            </header>
            <img src="{{ asset(['images/', blog.image]|join) }}" alt="{{ blog.title }} image not found" class="large" />
            <div>
                <p>{{ blog.blog }}</p>
            </div>
        </article>
    {% endblock %}

As you'd expect we begin by extending the ``BloggerBlogBundle`` main layout.
Next we override the page title with the title of the blog. This will
be useful for SEO as the page title of the blog is more descriptive
than the default title that is set. Lastly we override
the body block to output the ``Blog`` entity conent. We use the ``asset`` function
again here to render the blog image. The blog images should be placed in the
``web/images`` folder.

CSS
...

In order to ensure the blog show page looks beautiful, we need to add some styling.
Update the stylesheet located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resouces/public/css/blog.css``
with the following.

.. code-block:: css

    .date { margin-bottom: 20px; border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc; font-size: 24px; color: #666; line-height: 30px }
    .blog { margin-bottom: 20px; }
    .blog img { width: 190px; float: left; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; }
    .blog .meta { clear: left; margin-bottom: 20px; }
    .blog .snippet p.continue { margin-bottom: 0; text-align: right; }
    .blog .meta { font-style: italic; font-size: 12px; color: #666; }
    .blog .meta p { margin-bottom: 5px; line-height: 1.2em; }
    .blog img.large { width: 300px; min-height: 165px; }

.. note::

    If you are not using the symlink method for referencing bundle assets into the
    ``web`` folder you must re-run the assets install task now to copy over the
    changes to your CSS.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ php app/console assets:install web


As we have now built the controller and the view for the ``show`` actions
lets have a look at the show page. Point your browser to
``http://symblog.dev/app_dev.php/1``. Not the page you were expecting?

.. image:: /_static/images/part_3/404_not_found.jpg
    :align: center
    :alt: Symfony2 404 Not Found Exception

Symfony2 has generated a ``404 Not Found`` response. This is because we
have no data in our database, so no entity with ``id`` equal to 1 could be found.

You could simply insert a row into the blog table of your database, but we will use
a much better method; Data Fixtures.

Data Fixtures
-------------

We can use fixtures to populate the database with some sample/test data. To do this
we use the Doctrine Fixtures extension and bundle. The Doctrine Fixtures
extension and bundle do not come with the Symfony2 Standard Distribution, we need to
manually install them. Fortunately this is an easy task. Open up the ``composer.json`` file located
in the project root and add the Doctrine fixtures extension and bundle to it as
follows.

.. code-block:: php

    "require": {
        // ...
        "doctrine/doctrine-fixtures-bundle": "dev-master",
        "doctrine/data-fixtures" : "dev-master"
    }

Next update the vendors to reflect these changes.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php composer.phar update

This will pull down the latest version of each of the repositories from Github and
install them to the required location.

Now let's register the ``DoctrineFixturesBundle`` in the kernel located at
``app/AppKernel.php``

.. code-block:: php

    // app/AppKernel.php
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...
            new Doctrine\Bundle\FixturesBundle\DoctrineFixturesBundle(),
            // ...
        );
        // ...
    }

Blog Fixtures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are now ready to define some fixtures for our blogs. Create a fixture file at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/DataFixtures/ORM/BlogFixtures.php`` and add the following content:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/DataFixtures/ORM/BlogFixtures.php

    namespace Blogger\BlogBundle\DataFixtures\ORM;

    use Doctrine\Common\DataFixtures\FixtureInterface;
    use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;
    use Blogger\BlogBundle\Entity\Blog;

    class BlogFixtures implements FixtureInterface
    {
        public function load(ObjectManager $manager)
        {
            $blog1 = new Blog();
            $blog1->setTitle('A day with Symfony2');
            $blog1->setBlog('Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing eletra electrify denim vel ports.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Morbi ut velocity magna. Etiam vehicula nunc non leo hendrerit commodo. Vestibulum vulputate mauris eget erat congue dapibus imperdiet justo scelerisque. Nulla consectetur tempus nisl vitae viverra. Cras el mauris eget erat congue dapibus imperdiet justo scelerisque. Nulla consectetur tempus nisl vitae viverra. Cras elementum molestie vestibulum. Morbi id quam nisl.

Aliquam sollicitudin, augue id vestibulum iaculis, sem lectus convallis nunc, vel scelerisque lorem tortor ac nunc. Donec pharetra eleifend enim vel porta.');
            $blog1->setImage('beach.jpg');
            $blog1->setAuthor('dsyph3r');
            $blog1->setTags('symfony2, php, paradise, symblog');
            $blog1->setCreated(new \DateTime());
            $blog1->setUpdated($blog1->getCreated());
            $manager->persist($blog1);

            $blog2 = new Blog();
            $blog2->setTitle('The pool on the roof must have a leak');
            $blog2->setBlog('Vestibulum vulputate mauris eget erat congue dapibus imperdiet justo scelerisque. Na. Cras elementum molestie vestibulum. Morbi id quam nisl. Praesent hendrerit, orci sed elementum lobortis.');
            $blog2->setImage('pool_leak.jpg');
            $blog2->setAuthor('Zero Cool');
            $blog2->setTags('pool, leaky, hacked, movie, hacking, symblog');
            $blog2->setCreated(new \DateTime("2011-07-23 06:12:33"));
            $blog2->setUpdated($blog2->getCreated());
            $manager->persist($blog2);

            $blog3 = new Blog();
            $blog3->setTitle('Misdirection. What the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes');
            $blog3->setBlog('Lorem ipsumvehicula nunc non leo hendrerit commodo. Vestibulum vulputate mauris eget erat congue dapibus imperdiet justo scelerisque.');
            $blog3->setImage('misdirection.jpg');
            $blog3->setAuthor('Gabriel');
            $blog3->setTags('misdirection, magic, movie, hacking, symblog');
            $blog3->setCreated(new \DateTime("2011-07-16 16:14:06"));
            $blog3->setUpdated($blog3->getCreated());
            $manager->persist($blog3);

            $blog4 = new Blog();
            $blog4->setTitle('The grid - A digital frontier');
            $blog4->setBlog('Lorem commodo. Vestibulum vulputate mauris eget erat congue dapibus imperdiet justo scelerisque. Nulla consectetur tempus nisl vitae viverra.');
            $blog4->setImage('the_grid.jpg');

            $blog4->setTags('grid, daftpunk, movie, symblog');
            $blog4->setCreated(new \DateTime("2011-06-02 18:54:12"));

            $blog5->setUpdated($blog5->getCreated());
            $manager->persist($blog5);

            $manager->flush();
        }

    }

The fixture file demonstrates a number of important features when using Doctrine 2,
including how to persist entities to the database.

Let's look at how we create one blog entry.

.. code-block:: php

    $blog1 = new Blog();
    $blog1->setTitle('A day in paradise - A day with Symfony2');
    $blog1->setBlog('Lorem ipsum dolor sit d us imperdiet justo scelerisque. Nulla consectetur...');
    $blog1->setImage('beach.jpg');
    $blog1->setAuthor('dsyph3r');
    $blog1->setTags('symfony2, php, paradise, symblog');
    $blog1->setCreated(new \DateTime());
    $blog1->setUpdated($this->getCreated());
    $manager->persist($blog1);
    // ..

    $manager->flush();

We start by creating an object of ``Blog`` and setting some values for its
members. At this point Doctrine 2 knows nothing about the ``Entity`` object. It's
only when we make a call to ``$manager->persist($blog1)`` that we instruct
Doctrine 2 to start managing this entity object. The ``$manager`` object here
is an instance of the ``EntityManager`` object we saw earlier when retrieving
entites from the database. It is important to note that while
Doctrine 2 is now aware of the entity object, it is still not persisted to the
database. A call to ``$manager->flush()`` is required for this. The flush
method causes Doctrine 2 to actually interact with the database and action all the
entities it is managing. For best performance you should group Doctrine 2
operations together and flush all the actions in one go. This is how we have
done so in our fixtures. We create each entity, ask Doctrine 2 to manage it and
then flush all operations at the end.

.. tip:

    You may have noticed the setting of the ``created`` and ``updated`` members. This is not
    an ideal way to set these fields as you'd expect them to be set automatically
    when an object is created or updated. Doctrine 2 provides a way for us to achieve this
    which we will explore shortly.

Loading the fixtures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are now ready to load the fixtures into the database.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console doctrine:fixtures:load

If we have a look at the show page at ``http://symblog.dev/app_dev.php/1``
you should see a blog the blog entry.

.. image:: /_static/images/part_3/blog_show.jpg
    :align: center
    :alt: The symblog blog show page

Try changing the ``id`` parameter in the URL to 2. You should see the next blog entry
being shown.

If you have a look at the URL ``http://symblog.dev/app_dev.php/100`` you should see
a ``404 Not Found`` exception being thrown. You'd expect this as there is no ``Blog``
entity with an ID of 100. Now try the URL ``http://symblog.dev/app_dev.php/symfony2-blog``.
Why don't we get a ``404 Not Found`` exception? This is because the ``show`` action is
never executed. The URL fails to match any route in the application because of the
``\d+`` requirement we set on the ``BloggerBlogBundle_blog_show`` route. This
is why you see a ``No route found for "GET /symfony2-blog"`` exception.

Timestamps
----------

Finally in this chapter we will look at the 2 timestamp members on the ``Blog`` entity;
``created`` and ``updated``. The functionality for these 2 members is commonly referred to as
the ``Timestampable`` behavior. These members hold the time the blog was created and
the time the blog was last updated. As we don't want to have to manually set these fields
each time we create or update a blog, we can use Doctrine 2 to help us.

Doctrine 2 comes with an
`Event System <http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/orm/2.0/en/reference/events.html>`_
that provides
`Lifecycle Callbacks <http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/orm/2.0/en/reference/events.html#lifecycle-callbacks>`_.
We can use these callback events to register our entities to be notified of events
during the entity lifetime. Some example of events we can be notified about
include before an update happens, after a persist happens and after a remove happens.
In order to use Lifecycle Callbacks on our entity we need to register the entity for them.
This is done using metadata on the entity. Update the ``Blog`` entity located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php`` with the following.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php

    // ..

    /**
     * @ORM\Entity
     * @ORM\Table(name="blog")
     * @ORM\HasLifecycleCallbacks
     */
    class Blog
    {
        // ..
    }

Now let's add a method in the ``Blog`` entity that registers for the ``PreUpdate``
event. We also add a constructor to set default values for the ``created`` and
``updated`` members.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php

    // ..

    /**
     * @ORM\Entity
     * @ORM\Table(name="blog")
     * @ORM\HasLifecycleCallbacks
     */
    class Blog
    {
        // ..

        public function __construct()
        {
            $this->setCreated(new \DateTime());
            $this->setUpdated(new \DateTime());
        }

        /**
         * @ORM\PreUpdate
         */
        public function setUpdatedValue()
        {
           $this->setUpdated(new \DateTime());
        }

        // ..
    }

We register the ``Blog`` entity to be notified on the ``preUpdate`` event to set the
``updated`` member value. Now when you re-run the load fixtures task you will notice the
``created`` and ``updated`` members are set automatically.

.. tip::

    As timestampable members are such a common requirement for entities, there is
    a bundle available that supports them. The
    `StofDoctrineExtensionsBundle <https://github.com/stof/StofDoctrineExtensionsBundle>`_
    provides a number of useful Doctrine 2 extensions including Timestampable,
    Sluggable, and Sortable.

    We will look at integrating this bundle later in the tutorial. The eager
    ones among you can check the
    `cookbook <http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/doctrine/common_extensions.html>`_
    for a chapter on this topic.

Conclusion
----------

We have covered a number of concepts for dealing with models in Doctrine 2.
We also looked at defining Data fixtures to provide us with an easy way to get
suitable test data into our application duration development and testing.

Next we will look at extending the model further by adding the comment entity.
We will start to construct the homepage and create a custom Repository to do this.
We will also introduce the concept of Doctrine Migrations and how forms
interact with Doctrine 2 to allow comments to be posted for a blog.
