[Part 5] - Customising the view: Twig extensions, The sidebar and Assetic
=========================================================================

Overview
--------

This chapter will continue to build on the frontend of symblog. We will tweak
the homepage to display information regarding comments for a blog post along
with addressing SEO by adding the blog title to the URL. We will also begin work
on the sidebar to add 2 common blog components; The Tag Cloud and the Latest
Comments. We will explore the various environments in Symfony2 and learn how to
run symblog in the production environment. The Twig templating engine will be
extended to provide a new filter, and we introduce Assetic to manage the
website asset files. At the end of this chapter you will have integrated
comments into the homepage, have a Tag Cloud and Latest Comments component on the
sidebar and will have used Assetic to manage the asset files. You will also have seen
symblog running in the production environment.

The Homepage - Blogs and Comments
---------------------------------

So far the homepage lists the latest blog entries but it doesn't give any
information regarding the comments for those blogs. Now that we have the
``Comment`` entity built we can revisit the homepage to provide this information.
As we have set up the link between ``Blog`` and ``Comment`` entities we know
Doctrine 2 will be able to retrieve the comments for a blog (remember we added a
``$comments`` member to the ``Blog`` entity). Let's update the homepage view template
located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/index.html.twig`` with
the following.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/index.html.twig #}

    {# .. #}
    
    <footer class="meta">
        <p>Comments: {{ blog.comments|length }}</p>
        <p>Posted by <span class="highlight">{{ blog.author }}</span> at {{ blog.created|date('h:iA') }}</p>
        <p>Tags: <span class="highlight">{{ blog.tags }}</span></p>
    </footer>
    
    {# .. #}

We have used the ``comments`` getter to retrieve the blog comments and then passed
the collection through the Twig ``length`` filter. If you have a look
at the homepage now via ``http://symblog.dev/app_dev.php/`` you will see the
number of comments for each blog being displayed.

As explained above, we already informed Doctrine 2 that the ``$comments`` member of the
``Blog`` entity is mapped to the ``Comment`` entity. We achieved this in the previous chapter
with the following metadata in the ``Blog`` entity located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php``.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php

    /**
     * @ORM\OneToMany(targetEntity="Comment", mappedBy="blog")
     */
    protected $comments;

So we know Doctrine 2 is aware of the relationship between blogs and comments, but
how did it populate the ``$comments`` member with the related ``Comment``
entities? If you remember back to the ``BlogRepository`` method we created (shown
below) to get the homepage blogs we made no selection to retrieve the related ``Comment`` entities.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Repository/BlogRepository.php
    
    public function getLatestBlogs($limit = null)
    {
        $qb = $this->createQueryBuilder('b')
                   ->select('b')
                   ->addOrderBy('b.created', 'DESC');

        if (false === is_null($limit))
            $qb->setMaxResults($limit);

        return $qb->getQuery()
                  ->getResult();
    }
    
However, Doctrine 2 uses a process called lazy loading where the ``Comment`` entities are
retrieved from the database as and when required, in our case when the call to
``{{ blog.comments|length }}`` is made. We can demonstrate this process using
the developer toolbar. We have already started to explore the basics of the developer
toolbar and it's now time to introduce one of its most useful features, the Doctrine 2
profiler. The Doctrine 2 profiler can be accessed by clicking the last icon in
the developer toolbar. The number next to this icon shows the number of queries
executed on the database for the current HTTP request.

.. image:: /_static/images/part_5/doctrine_2_toolbar_icon.jpg
    :align: center
    :alt: Developer toolbar - Doctrine 2 icon

If you click the Doctrine 2 icon you will be presented with information
regarding the queries that were executed by Doctrine 2 on the database for the
current HTTP request.

.. image:: /_static/images/part_5/doctrine_2_toolbar_queries.jpg
    :align: center
    :alt: Developer toolbar - Doctrine 2 queries

As you can see in the above screen shot, there are a number of queries executed
for a request to the homepage. The second query executed retrieves the blog
entities from the database and is executed as a result of the
``getLatestBlogs()`` method on the ``BlogRepository`` class. Following this
query you will notice a number of queries that pull comments from the database,
one blog at a time. We can see this because of the ``WHERE t0.blog_id = ?`` in
each of the queries, where the ``?`` is replaced by the Parameter value (the blog
Id) on the following line. Each of these queries are as a result of the calls to
``{{ blog.comments }}`` in the homepage template. Each time this function is
executed, Doctrine 2 has to lazily load the ``Comment`` entities that relate to
the ``Blog`` entity.

While lazy loading is very effective at retrieving related entities from the database,
it's not always the most efficient way to perform this task. Doctrine 2 provides the ability
to ``join`` related entities together when querying the database. This way we can
pull the ``Blog`` and related ``Comment`` entities out from the database in one query.
Update the ``QueryBuilder`` code in the ``BlogRepository`` located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Repository/BlogRepository.php`` to join on the comments.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Repository/BlogRepository.php

    public function getLatestBlogs($limit = null)
    {
        $qb = $this->createQueryBuilder('b')
                   ->select('b, c')
                   ->leftJoin('b.comments', 'c')
                   ->addOrderBy('b.created', 'DESC');

        if (false === is_null($limit))
            $qb->setMaxResults($limit);

        return $qb->getQuery()
                  ->getResult();
    }

If you now refresh the homepage and examine the Doctrine 2 output in the developer
toolbar you will notice the number of queries has dropped. You can also see the comment
table has been joined to the blog table.

Lazy loading and joining related entities are both very powerful concepts but
they need to be used correctly. The correct balance between the 2 needs to be
found to ensure your application is running as efficiently as possible. At first
it might seem great to join on every related entity so you never need to lazy
load and your database query count will always remain low. However, it's
important to remember that the more information you retrieve from the database,
the more processing needs to be done by Doctrine 2 to hydrate this into the
entity objects. More data also means more memory is used by the server to store
the entity objects.

Before moving on let's make one minor addition to the homepage template for the
number of comments we have just added. Update the homepage template located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/index.html.twig`` to add a link to
show the blog comments.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/index.html.twig #}

    {# .. #}
    
    <footer class="meta">
        <p>Comments: <a href="{{ path('BloggerBlogBundle_blog_show', { 'id': blog.id }) }}#comments">{{ blog.comments|length }}</a></p>
        <p>Posted by <span class="highlight">{{ blog.author }}</span> at {{ blog.created|date('h:iA') }}</p>
        <p>Tags: <span class="highlight">{{ blog.tags }}</span></p>
    </footer>
    
    {# .. #}
            
The Sidebar
-----------

Currently the sidebar of symblog is looking a bit empty. We will update this
with 2 common blog components, the Tag Cloud and a list of the Latest Comments.

Tag Cloud
~~~~~~~~~

The Tag Cloud shows tags for each blog emphasized in a way that displays the
more common tags bolder. To achieve this we need a way to retrieve all the tags
for all the blogs. Let's create some new methods in the ``BlogRepository`` class
to do this. Update the ``BlogRepository`` class located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Repository/BlogRepository.php`` with the following.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Repository/BlogRepository.php

    public function getTags()
    {
        $blogTags = $this->createQueryBuilder('b')
                         ->select('b.tags')
                         ->getQuery()
                         ->getResult();

        $tags = array();
        foreach ($blogTags as $blogTag)
        {
            $tags = array_merge(explode(",", $blogTag['tags']), $tags);
        }

        foreach ($tags as &$tag)
        {
            $tag = trim($tag);
        }

        return $tags;
    }

    public function getTagWeights($tags)
    {
        $tagWeights = array();
        if (empty($tags))
            return $tagWeights;
        
        foreach ($tags as $tag)
        {
            $tagWeights[$tag] = (isset($tagWeights[$tag])) ? $tagWeights[$tag] + 1 : 1;
        }
        // Shuffle the tags
        uksort($tagWeights, function() {
            return rand() > rand();
        });
        
        $max = max($tagWeights);
        
        // Max of 5 weights
        $multiplier = ($max > 5) ? 5 / $max : 1;
        foreach ($tagWeights as &$tag)
        {
            $tag = ceil($tag * $multiplier);
        }
    
        return $tagWeights;
    }

As the tags are stored in the database as comma separated values (CSV) we need a
way to split them and return them as an array. This is achieved by the ``getTags()``
method. The ``getTagWeights()`` method is then able to use an array of tags to calculate
the weight of each tag based on its popularity within the array. The tags are also
shuffled to randomise their display on the page.

Now we are able to generate the Tag Cloud, we need to display it. Create a new
action in the ``PageController`` located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/PageController.php`` to handle the sidebar.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/PageController.php
    
    public function sidebarAction()
    {
        $em = $this->getDoctrine()
                   ->getManager();

        $tags = $em->getRepository('BloggerBlogBundle:Blog')
                   ->getTags();

        $tagWeights = $em->getRepository('BloggerBlogBundle:Blog')
                         ->getTagWeights($tags);

        return $this->render('BloggerBlogBundle:Page:sidebar.html.twig', array(
            'tags' => $tagWeights
        ));
    }

The action is very simple, it uses the 2 new ``BlogRepository`` methods to generate
the Tag Cloud, and passes this over to the view. Now let's create this view located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/sidebar.html.twig``.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/sidebar.html.twig #}
    
    <section class="section">
        <header>
            <h3>Tag Cloud</h3>
        </header>
        <p class="tags">
            {% for tag, weight in tags %}
                <span class="weight-{{ weight }}">{{ tag }}</span>
            {% else %}
                There are no tags
            {% endfor %}
        </p>
    </section>

The template is also very simple. It just iterates over the various tags
setting a class to the weight of the tag. The ``for`` loop introduces how to
access the ``key`` and ``value`` pairs of the array, with ``tag`` being the key
and ``weight`` being the value. There are a number of variations of how to use
the ``for`` loop provided in the
`Twig documentation <http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/templates.html#for>`_.

Now that we have the template done, we'll be render the sidebar inside our main layout template.
To do this, we'll want to create a new entry in our routing file located at

``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml``

.. code-block:: yml
    
    # src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml
    BloggerBlogBundle_sidebar:
    pattern:  /sidebar
    defaults: { _controller: BloggerBlogBundle:Page:sidebar }
    requirements:
        _method:  GET

If you look back at the ``BloggerBlogBundle`` main layout template located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/layout.html.twig`` you will notice
we put a placeholder in for the sidebar block. Let's replace this now by rendering
the new sidebar action. Remember from the previous chapter that the Twig ``render``
method will render the contents from a controller action using the ``sidebar`` route.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/layout.html.twig #}

    {# .. #}

    {% block sidebar %}
        {% render url("BloggerBlogBundle_sidebar") %}
    {% endblock %}

Finally let's add the CSS for the tag cloud. Add a new stylesheet located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/public/css/sidebar.css``.

.. code-block:: css

    .sidebar .section { margin-bottom: 20px; }
    .sidebar h3 { line-height: 1.2em; font-size: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-weight: normal; background: #eee; padding: 5px;  }
    .sidebar p { line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 20px; }
    .sidebar ul { list-style: none }
    .sidebar ul li { line-height: 1.5em }
    .sidebar .small { font-size: 12px; }
    .sidebar .comment p { margin-bottom: 5px; }
    .sidebar .comment { margin-bottom: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; }
    .sidebar .tags { font-weight: bold; }
    .sidebar .tags span { color: #000; font-size: 12px; }
    .sidebar .tags .weight-1 { font-size: 12px; }
    .sidebar .tags .weight-2 { font-size: 15px; }
    .sidebar .tags .weight-3 { font-size: 18px; }
    .sidebar .tags .weight-4 { font-size: 21px; }
    .sidebar .tags .weight-5 { font-size: 24px; }

As we have added a new stylesheet we need to include it. Update the
``BloggerBlogBundle`` main layout template located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/layout.html.twig`` with the following.

.. code-block:: html
    
    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/layout.html.twig #}

    {# .. #}
    
    {% block stylesheets %}
        {{ parent() }}
        <link href="{{ asset('bundles/bloggerblog/css/blog.css') }}" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
        <link href="{{ asset('bundles/bloggerblog/css/sidebar.css') }}" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
    {% endblock %}
    
    {# .. #}

.. note::

    If you are not using the symlink method for referencing bundle assets into the
    ``web`` folder you must re-run the assets install task now to copy over the
    new CSS file.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ php app/console assets:install web
        
If you now refresh the symblog website you will see the Tag Cloud rendered in the sidebar.
In order to get the tags to render with different weights, you may need to update
the blog fixtures so some tags are used more than others.

Recent Comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now the Tag Cloud is in place, let's also add the Latest Comments component to the
sidebar.

First we need a way to retrieve the latest comments for the blogs. To do this
we will add a new method to the ``CommentRepository`` located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Repository/CommentRepository.php``.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Repository/CommentRepository.php

    public function getLatestComments($limit = 10)
    {
        $qb = $this->createQueryBuilder('c')
                    ->select('c')
                    ->addOrderBy('c.id', 'DESC');

        if (false === is_null($limit))
            $qb->setMaxResults($limit);

        return $qb->getQuery()
                  ->getResult();
    }

Next update the sidebar action located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/PageController.php``
to retrieve the latest comments and pass them over to the view.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/PageController.php
    
    public function sidebarAction()
    {
        // ..

        $commentLimit   = $this->container
                               ->getParameter('blogger_blog.comments.latest_comment_limit');
        $latestComments = $em->getRepository('BloggerBlogBundle:Comment')
                             ->getLatestComments($commentLimit);
    
        return $this->render('BloggerBlogBundle:Page:sidebar.html.twig', array(
            'latestComments'    => $latestComments,
            'tags'              => $tagWeights
        ));
    }

You will notice we have used a new parameter called
``blogger_blog.comments.latest_comment_limit`` to limit the number of comments
retrieved. To create this parameter
update the config located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/config/config.yml`` with the following.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/config/config.yml
    
    parameters:
        # ..

        # Blogger max latest comments
        blogger_blog.comments.latest_comment_limit: 10

Finally we need to render the latest comments in the sidebar template. Update the
template located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/sidebar.html.twig``
with the following.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/sidebar.html.twig #}

    {# .. #}

    <section class="section">
        <header>
            <h3>Latest Comments</h3>
        </header>
        {% for comment in latestComments %}
            <article class="comment">
                <header>
                    <p class="small"><span class="highlight">{{ comment.user }}</span> commented on
                        <a href="{{ path('BloggerBlogBundle_blog_show', { 'id': comment.blog.id }) }}#comment-{{ comment.id }}">
                            {{ comment.blog.title }}
                        </a>
                        [<em><time datetime="{{ comment.created|date('c') }}">{{ comment.created|date('Y-m-d h:iA') }}</time></em>]
                    </p>
                </header>
                <p>{{ comment.comment }}</p>
            </article>
        {% else %}
            <p>There are no recent comments</p>
        {% endfor %}
    </section>

If you now refresh the symblog website you will see the Latest Comments
being displayed in the sidebar under the Tag Cloud.

Twig Extensions
---------------

So far we have been displaying the posted at dates for blog comments in a standard date format
such as `2011-04-21`. A much nicer approach would be to display comment dates in terms
of how long ago the comment was posted, such as `posted 3 hours ago`. We could
add a method to the ``Comment`` entity to achieve this and change the templates
to use this method instead of ``{{ comment.created|date('Y-m-d h:iA') }}``.

As we may want to use this functionality elsewhere it would make more sense to
move it out of the ``Comment`` entity. As transforming the date is specifically
a view layer task, we should implement this using the Twig templating engine.
Twig give us this ability by providing an Extension interface.

We can use the `extension <http://www.twig-project.org/doc/extensions.html>`_
interface in Twig to extend the default functionality it provides. We are
going to create a new Twig filter extension that can be used as follows.

.. code-block:: html
    
    {{ comment.created|created_ago }}
    
This would return the comment created date in a format such as `posted 2 days ago`.
    
The Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a file for the Twig extension located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Twig/Extensions/BloggerBlogExtension.php`` and updated with
the following content.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Twig/Extensions/BloggerBlogExtension.php

    namespace Blogger\BlogBundle\Twig\Extensions;

    class BloggerBlogExtension extends \Twig_Extension
    {
        public function getFilters()
        {
            return array(
                'created_ago' => new \Twig_Filter_Method($this, 'createdAgo'),
            );
        }

        public function createdAgo(\DateTime $dateTime)
        {
            $delta = time() - $dateTime->getTimestamp();
            if ($delta < 0)
                throw new \InvalidArgumentException("createdAgo is unable to handle dates in the future");

            $duration = "";
            if ($delta < 60)
            {
                // Seconds
                $time = $delta;
                $duration = $time . " second" . (($time > 1) ? "s" : "") . " ago";
            }
            else if ($delta <= 3600)
            {
                // Mins
                $time = floor($delta / 60);
                $duration = $time . " minute" . (($time > 1) ? "s" : "") . " ago";
            }
            else if ($delta <= 86400)
            {
                // Hours
                $time = floor($delta / 3600);
                $duration = $time . " hour" . (($time > 1) ? "s" : "") . " ago";
            }
            else
            {
                // Days
                $time = floor($delta / 86400);
                $duration = $time . " day" . (($time > 1) ? "s" : "") . " ago";
            }

            return $duration;
        }

        public function getName()
        {
            return 'blogger_blog_extension';
        }
    }

Creating the extension is quite simple. We override the ``getFilters()`` method
to return any number of filters we want to be available. In this case
we are creating the ``created_ago`` filter. This filter is then registered to use the
``createdAgo`` method, which simply transforms a ``DateTime`` object into a
string representing the duration passed since the value stored in the ``DateTime`` object.

Registering the Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make the Twig extension available we need to update the services file
located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/config/services.yml`` with
the following.

.. code-block:: yaml

    services:
        blogger_blog.twig.extension:
            class: Blogger\BlogBundle\Twig\Extensions\BloggerBlogExtension
            tags:
                - { name: twig.extension }

You can see this is registering a new service using the ``BloggerBlogExtension``
Twig extension class we have just created.

Updating the view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new Twig filter is now ready to be used. Let's update the sidebar Latest Comments
list to use the ``created_ago`` filter. Update the sidebar template located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/sidebar.html.twig`` with the following.


.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/sidebar.html.twig #}

    {# .. #}
    
    <section class="section">
        <header>
            <h3>Latest Comments</h3>
        </header>
        {% for comment in latestComments %}
            {# .. #}
            <em><time datetime="{{ comment.created|date('c') }}">{{ comment.created|created_ago }}</time></em>
            {# .. #}
        {% endfor %}
    </section>

If you now point your browser to ``http://symblog.dev/app_dev.php/`` you will
see the latest comment dates are using the Twig filter to render the duration
since the comment was posted.

Let's also update the comments listed on the blog show page to use the new
filter. Replace the content in the template located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Comment/index.html.twig`` with the following.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Comment/index.html.twig #}

    {% for comment in comments %}
        <article class="comment {{ cycle(['odd', 'even'], loop.index0) }}" id="comment-{{ comment.id }}">
            <header>
                <p><span class="highlight">{{ comment.user }}</span> commented <time datetime="{{ comment.created|date('c') }}">{{ comment.created|created_ago }}</time></p>
            </header>
            <p>{{ comment.comment }}</p>
        </article>
    {% else %}
        <p>There are no comments for this post. Be the first to comment...</p>
    {% endfor %}

.. tip::

    There are a number of useful Twig extensions available via the
    `Twig-Extensions <https://github.com/fabpot/Twig-extensions>`_  library on GitHub.
    If you create a useful extension send over a pull request for this repository and
    it may get included for other people to use.

Slugifying the URL
------------------

Currently the URL for each blog post only shows the blog ID. While this is
perfectly acceptable from a functional point of view, it's not great for SEO.
For example, the URL ``http://symblog.dev/1`` doesn't give any information away about
the content of the blog, something like ``http://symblog.dev/1/a-day-with-symfony2``
would be much better. To achieve this we will slugify the blog title and use it
as part of this URL. Slugifying the title will remove all non ASCII characters
and replace them with a ``-``.

Update the routing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To begin let's modify the routing rule for the blog show page to add the slug component.
Update the routing rule located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml``

.. code-block:: yaml

    # src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml
    
    BloggerBlogBundle_blog_show:
        pattern:  /{id}/{slug}
        defaults: { _controller: BloggerBlogBundle:Blog:show }
        requirements:
            _method:  GET
            id: \d+

The controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As with the existing ``id`` component, the new ``slug`` component will be passed
into the controller action as an argument, so let's update the controller
located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/BlogController.php`` to reflect
this.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/BlogController.php

    public function showAction($id, $slug)
    {
        // ..
    }

.. tip::

    The order in which the arguments are passed into the controller action
    doesn't matter, only the name of them does. Symfony2 is able to match up the
    routing arguments with the parameter list for us. While we haven't yet used
    default component values it's worth mentioning them here. If we added another
    component onto the routing rule we can specify a default value for the component
    using the ``defaults`` option.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        BloggerBlogBundle_blog_show:
            pattern:  /{id}/{slug}/{comments}
            defaults: { _controller: BloggerBlogBundle:Blog:show, comments: true }
            requirements:
                _method:  GET
                id: \d+

    .. code-block:: php

        public function showAction($id, $slug, $comments)
        {
            // ..
        }

    Using this method, a request to ``http://symblog.dev/1/symfony2-blog`` would
    result in ``$comments`` being set to true in the ``showAction``.

Slugifying the title
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As we want to generate the slug from the blog title, we will auto generate the slug 
value. We could simply perform this operation at run time on the title field
but instead we will store the slug in the ``Blog`` entity and persist it to the database.

Updating the Blog entity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's add a new member to the ``Blog`` entity to store the slug. Update the ``Blog``
entity located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php``

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php

    class Blog
    {
        // ..

        /**
         * @ORM\Column(type="string")
         */
        protected $slug;

        // ..
    }

Now generate the accessors for the new ``$slug`` member. As before run the following task.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console doctrine:generate:entities Blogger

Next, let's update the database schema.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console doctrine:migrations:diff
    $ php app/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

To generate the slug value we will use the slugify method from the symfony 1
`Jobeet <http://www.symfony-project.org/jobeet/1_4/Propel/en/08>`_ tutorial.
Add the ``slugify`` method to the  the ``Blog`` entity located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php``

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php

    public function slugify($text)
    {
        // replace non letter or digits by -
        $text = preg_replace('#[^\\pL\d]+#u', '-', $text);

        // trim
        $text = trim($text, '-');

        // transliterate
        if (function_exists('iconv'))
        {
            $text = iconv('utf-8', 'us-ascii//TRANSLIT', $text);
        }

        // lowercase
        $text = strtolower($text);

        // remove unwanted characters
        $text = preg_replace('#[^-\w]+#', '', $text);

        if (empty($text))
        {
            return 'n-a';
        }

        return $text;
    }

As we want to auto generate the slug from the title we can generate the slug when
the value of the title is set. For this we can update the ``setTitle`` accessor
to also set the value of the slug. Update the ``Blog`` entity located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php`` with the following.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php

    public function setTitle($title)
    {
        $this->title = $title;

        $this->setSlug($this->title);
    }

Next update the ``setSlug`` method to slugify the slug before it is set.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Entity/Blog.php

    public function setSlug($slug)
    {
        $this->slug = $this->slugify($slug);
    }

Now reload the data fixtures to generate the blog slugs.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console doctrine:fixtures:load

Updating the generated routes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally we need to update the existing calls for generating routes to the blog
show page. There are a number of locations where this needs to be updated.

Open the homepage template located at
``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/index.html.twig`` and replace its
contents with the following. There have been 3 edits to the generation of the
``BloggerBlogBundle_blog_show`` route in this template. The edits simply
pass in the blog slug to the Twig ``path`` function.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/index.html.twig #}

    {% extends 'BloggerBlogBundle::layout.html.twig' %}

    {% block body %}
        {% for blog in blogs %}
            <article class="blog">
                <div class="date"><time datetime="{{ blog.created|date('c') }}">{{ blog.created|date('l, F j, Y') }}</time></div>
                <header>
                    <h2><a href="{{ path('BloggerBlogBundle_blog_show', { 'id': blog.id, 'slug': blog.slug }) }}">{{ blog.title }}</a></h2>
                </header>
    
                <img src="{{ asset(['images/', blog.image]|join) }}" />
                <div class="snippet">
                    <p>{{ blog.blog(500) }}</p>
                    <p class="continue"><a href="{{ path('BloggerBlogBundle_blog_show', { 'id': blog.id, 'slug': blog.slug }) }}">Continue reading...</a></p>
                </div>
    
                <footer class="meta">
                    <p>Comments: <a href="{{ path('BloggerBlogBundle_blog_show', { 'id': blog.id, 'slug': blog.slug }) }}#comments">{{ blog.comments|length }}</a></p>
                    <p>Posted by <span class="highlight">{{ blog.author }}</span> at {{ blog.created|date('h:iA') }}</p>
                    <p>Tags: <span class="highlight">{{ blog.tags }}</span></p>
                </footer>
            </article>
        {% else %}
            <p>There are no blog entries for symblog</p>
        {% endfor %}
    {% endblock %}

Also, one update needs to be made to the Latest Comments section of the sidebar
template located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/sidebar.html.twig``.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/Page/sidebar.html.twig #}

    {# .. #}

    <a href="{{ path('BloggerBlogBundle_blog_show', { 'id': comment.blog.id, 'slug': comment.blog.slug }) }}#comment-{{ comment.id }}">
        {{ comment.blog.title }}
    </a>

    {# .. #}

Finally the ``createAction`` of the ``CommentController`` needs to be updated
when redirecting to the blog show page on a successful comment posting. Update
the ``CommentController`` located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/CommentController.php``
with the following.

.. code-block:: php

    // src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Controller/CommentController.php
    
    public function createAction($blog_id)
    {
        // ..

        if ($form->isValid()) {
            // ..
                
            return $this->redirect($this->generateUrl('BloggerBlogBundle_blog_show', array(
                'id'    => $comment->getBlog()->getId(),
                'slug'  => $comment->getBlog()->getSlug())) .
                '#comment-' . $comment->getId()
            );
        }

        // ..
    }

Now if you navigate to the symblog homepage at ``http://symblog.dev/app_dev.php/``
and click one of the blog titles you will see the blog slug has been
appended to the end of the URL.

Environments
------------

Environments are a very powerful, yet simple feature provided by Symfony2. You may
not be aware, but you have been using environments from part 1 of this tutorial.
With environments we can configure various aspects of Symfony2 and the application
to run differently depending on the specific needs during the applications life cycle.
By default Symfony2 comes configured with 3 environments:

1. ``dev`` - Development
2. ``test`` - Test
3. ``prod`` - Production

The purpose of these environments is self explanatory, but what about these environments
would be configured differently for their individual needs. When developing the
application it's useful to have the developer toolbar on screen with descriptive
exceptions and errors being displayed, while in production you don't want any
of this. In fact, having this information displayed would be a security risk as a lot of
details regarding the internals of the application and the server would be
exposed. In production it would be better to display customised error pages
with simplified messages, while quietly logging this information to text files.
It would also be useful to have the caching layer enabled to ensure the
application is running at its best. Having the caching layer enabled in the
``development`` environment would be a pain as you would need to empty the cache
each time you made changes to config files, etc.

The other environment is the ``test`` environment. This is used when running
tests on the application such as unit or functional test. We haven't covered
testing yet, but rest assured it will be covered in depth in the coming chapters.

Front Controllers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So far through this tutorial we have been using the ``development`` environment
only. We have been specifying to run in the ``development`` environment by using the
``app_dev.php`` front controller when making requests to symblog, eg
``http://symblog.dev/app_dev.php/about``. If we have a look at the front
controller located at ``web/app_dev.php`` you will see the following line:

.. code-block:: php

    $kernel = new AppKernel('dev', true);

This line is what kick starts Symfony2 going. It instantiates a new instance of
the Symfony2 ``AppKernel`` and sets the environment to ``dev``.

In contrast, if we look at the front controller for the ``production`` environment
located at ``web/app.php`` we see the following:

.. code-block:: php

    $kernel = new AppKernel('prod', false);

You can see the ``prod`` environment is passed into the ``AppKernel`` in this instance.

The test environment is not supposed to be run via the web browser which is why there
is no ``app_test.php`` front controller.

Configuration Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have seen above how the front controllers are utilised to change the environment
the application runs under. Now we will explore how the various settings are
modified while running under each environment. If you have a look at the files in 
``app/config`` you will see a number of ``config.yml`` files. Specifically
there is one main one, called ``config.yml`` and 3 others all suffixed with the
name of an environment; ``config_dev.yml``, ``config_test.yml`` and ``config_prod.yml``.
Each of these files is loaded depending on the current environment. If we explore the
``config_dev.yml`` file you will see the following lines at the top.

.. code-block:: yaml

    imports:
        - { resource: config.yml }

The ``imports`` directive will cause the ``config.yml`` file to be included into
this file. The same ``imports`` directive can be found at the top of the other 2
environment config files, ``config_test.yml`` and ``config_prod.yml``. By
including a common set of config settings defined in ``config.yml`` we are able
to override specific settings for each environment. We can
see in the ``development`` config file located at ``app/config/config_dev.yml``
the following lines configuring the use of the developer toolbar.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config_dev.yml
    
    web_profiler:
        toolbar: true

This setting is absent from the ``production`` config file as we don't want the
developer toolbar displayed.

Running in Production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For those of you eager to see your site running in the ``production`` environment
now is the time.

First we need to clear the cache using one of the Symfony2 tasks.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console cache:clear --env=prod

Now point your browser to ``http://symblog.dev/``. Notice the ``app_dev.php`` front
controller is missing.

.. note::
    
    For those of you using the Dynamic Virtual Hosts configuration as linked to in
    part 1, you will need to add the following to the .htaccess file located
    at ``web/.htaccess``.
    
    .. code-block:: text
    
        <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
            RewriteBase /
            # ..
        </IfModule>
        

You will notice the site looks pretty much the same, but a few important
features are different. The developer toolbar is now gone and the detailed
exception message are no longer displayed, try going to ``http://symblog.dev/999``.

.. image:: /_static/images/part_5/production_error.jpg
    :align: center
    :alt: Production - 404 Error
    
The detailed exception message has been replaced by a simplified message informing
the user of the problem. These exception screens can be customised to match the look
and feel of your application. We will explore this in later chapters.

Furthermore, you'll notice the ``app/logs/prod.log`` file is filling up with logs regarding
the execution of the application. This is a useful point of call when you have
issues with the application in ``production`` as errors and exceptions won't be displayed on
the screen any more.

.. tip::

    How did the request to ``http://symblog.dev/`` end up being routed through the
    file ``app.php``? I'm sure you're all used to creating files such as ``index.html``
    and ``index.php`` that act as the site's index, but how would ``app.php``
    become this? This is thanks to a RewriteRule in the file ``web/.htaccess``

    .. code-block:: text

        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ app.php [QSA,L]

    We can see that this line has a regular expression that matches any text,
    denoted by ``^(.*)$`` and passes this to ``app.php``.

    You may be on an Apache server that doesn't have the ``mod_rewrite.c``
    enabled. If this is the case you can simply add ``app.php`` to the URL such as
    ``http://symblog.dev/app.php/``.

While we have covered the basics of the ``production`` environment, we have not
covered many other ``production`` related tasks such as customising
error pages, and deployment to the ``production`` server using tools such as
`capifony <http://capifony.org/>`_. These topics will be covered in later chapters.

Creating New Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally it's worth noting that you can setup your own environments easily in Symfony2.
For example, you may want a staging environment that would run on the production
server, but output some of the debugging information such as exceptions. This
would allow the platform to be tested manually on the actual production server
as production and development configurations of servers can differ.

While creating a new environment is a simple task, it is outside the scope of this
tutorial. There is an excellent
`article <http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/configuration/environments.html>`_
in the Symfony2 cookbook that covers this.

Assetic
-------

The Symfony2 Standard Distribution is bundled with a library for assets
management called `Assetic <https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic>`_. The library was
developed by `Kris Wallsmith <https://twitter.com/#!/kriswallsmith>`_ and was
inspired by the Python library `webassets
<http://elsdoerfer.name/files/docs/webassets/>`_.

Assetic deals with 2 parts of asset management, the assets such as images,
stylesheets and JavaScript and the filters that can be applied to these assets.
These filters are able to perform useful tasks such as minifying your CSS and
JavaScript, passing `CoffeeScript <http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/>`_
files through the CoffeeScript compiler, and combining asset files together to
reduce the number of HTTP requests made to the server.

Currently we have been using the Twig ``asset`` function to include assets into
the template as follows.

.. code-block:: html
    
    <link href="{{ asset('bundles/bloggerblog/css/blog.css') }}" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />

The calls to the ``asset`` function will be replaced by Assetic.

Assets
~~~~~~

The Assetic library describes an asset as follows:

`An Assetic asset is something with filterable content that can be loaded and
dumped. An asset also includes metadata, some of which can be manipulated and
some of which is immutable.`

Put simply, the assets are the resources the application uses such as stylesheets
and images.

To enable Assetic for the ``BloggerBlogBundle`` we have to change the ``app/config/config.yml`` as follows.

.. code-block:: php

    # ..
    assetic:
        bundles:    [BloggerBlogBundle]
    # ..

This will enable Assetic just for the ``BloggerBlogBundle`` and will require adjustments whenever
a new bundle needs to use Assetic. We can however completely remove the ``bundles`` line and enable
it for all future bundles aswell.

Stylesheets
...........

Let's begin by replacing the current calls to ``asset`` for the stylesheets
in the ``BloggerBlogBundle`` main layout template. Update the content of the template
located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/layout.html.twig``
with the following.

.. code-block:: html
    
    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/layout.html.twig #}
    
    {# .. #}

    {% block stylesheets %}
        {{ parent () }}
        
        {% stylesheets 
            '@BloggerBlogBundle/Resources/public/css/*'
        %}
            <link href="{{ asset_url }}" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" />
        {% endstylesheets %}
    {% endblock %}
    
    {# .. #}

We have replaced the 2 previous links for CSS files with some Assetic
functionality. Using ``stylesheets`` from Assetic we have specified that all CSS
files in the location ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/public/css`` should be
combined into 1 file and then output. Combining files is a very simple but
effective way to optimise your website frontend by reducing the number of files
needed. Fewer files means fewer HTTP requests to the server. While we used the
``*`` to specify all files in the ``css`` directory we could have simply listed
each file individually as follows.

.. code-block:: html
    
    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/layout.html.twig #}
    
    {# .. #}

    {% block stylesheets %}
        {{ parent () }}
        
        {% stylesheets 
            '@BloggerBlogBundle/Resources/public/css/blog.css'
            '@BloggerBlogBundle/Resources/public/css/sidebar.css'
        %}
            <link href="{{ asset_url }}" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" />
        {% endstylesheets %}
    {% endblock %}

    {# .. #}
    
The end result in both cases is the same. The first option using the ``*`` ensures
that when new CSS files are added to the directory, they will always be included in the combined CSS
file by Assetic. This may not be the desired functionality for your website, so
use either method above to suit your needs.
    
If you have a look at the HTML output via ``http://symblog.dev/app_dev.php/``
you will see the CSS has been included something like this (Notice we
are running back in the ``development`` environment again).

.. code-block:: html
    
    <link href="/app_dev.php/css/d8f44a4_part_1_blog_1.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" />
    <link href="/app_dev.php/css/d8f44a4_part_1_sidebar_2.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" />
    
Firstly you may be wondering why there are 2 files. Above it was stated that Assetic
would combine the files into 1 CSS file. This is because we are running symblog
in the ``development`` environment. We can ask Assetic to run in non-debug mode
by setting the debug flag to false as follows.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/layout.html.twig #}
    
    {# .. #}
    
    {% stylesheets 
        '@BloggerBlogBundle/Resources/public/css/*'
        debug=false
    %}
        <link href="{{ asset_url }}" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" />
    {% endstylesheets %}

    {# .. #}
    
Now if you look at the rendered HTML you will see something like this.

.. code-block:: html

    <link href="/app_dev.php/css/3c7da45.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" />
    
If you view the contents of this file you will see the 2 CSS files, ``blog.css``
and ``sidebar.css`` have been combined into 1 file. The filename given to the generated
CSS file is randomly generated by Assetic. If you would like to control the name
given to the generated file use the ``output`` option as follows.

.. code-block:: html

    {% stylesheets 
        '@BloggerBlogBundle/Resources/public/css/*'
        output='css/blogger.css'
    %}
        <link href="{{ asset_url }}" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" />
    {% endstylesheets %}

Before you continue remove the debug flag from the previous snippet as we want
to resume default behavior on the assets.

We also need to update the applications base template located at
``app/Resources/views/base.html.twig``.

.. code-block:: html

    {# app/Resources/views/base.html.twig #}
    
    {# .. #}
    
    {% block stylesheets %}
        <link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Irish+Grover' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
        <link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=La+Belle+Aurore' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
        {% stylesheets 
            'css/*'
        %}
            <link href="{{ asset_url }}" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" />
        {% endstylesheets %}
    {% endblock %}

JavaScripts
...........

While we currently don't have any JavaScipt files in our application, its usage in
Assetic is much the same as using stylesheets.

.. code-block:: html

    {% javascripts 
        '@BloggerBlogBundle/Resources/public/js/*'
    %}
        <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ asset_url }}"></script>
    {% endjavascripts %}

Filters
~~~~~~~

The real power in Assetic comes from the filters. Filters can be applied to assets
or collections of assets. There are a large number of filters
provided within the core of the library including the following common filters:

1. ``CssMinFilter``: minifies CSS
2. ``JpegoptimFilter``: optimize your JPEGs
3. ``Yui\CssCompressorFilter``: compresses CSS using the YUI compressor
4. ``Yui\JsCompressorFilter``: compresses JavaScript using the YUI compressor
5. ``CoffeeScriptFilter``: compiles CoffeeScript into JavaScript

There is a full list of available filters in the
`Assetic Readme <https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic/blob/master/README.md>`_.

Many of these filters pass the actual task onto another program or library, such
as YUI Compressor, so you may need to install/configure the appropriate libraries
to use some of the filters.

Download the `YUI Compressor <http://yuilibrary.com/download/yuicompressor/>`_, extract
the archive and copy the file located in the ``build`` directory to
``app/Resources/java/yuicompressor-2.4.6.jar``. This assumes you downloaded the
``2.4.6`` version of the YUI Compressor. If not change your version number accordingly.

Next we will configure an Assetic filter to minify the CSS using the YUI Compressor.
Update the application config located at ``app/config/config.yml`` with the following.

.. code-block:: yaml
    
    # app/config/config.yml
    
    # ..

    assetic:
        filters:
            yui_css:
                jar: %kernel.root_dir%/Resources/java/yuicompressor-2.4.6.jar
    
    # ..
    
We have configured a filter called ``yui_css`` that will use the YUI Compressor
Java executable we placed in the applications resources directory. In order
to use the filter you need to specify which assets you want the filter applied to.
Update the template located at ``src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/layout.html.twig``
to apply the ``yui_css`` filter.

.. code-block:: html

    {# src/Blogger/BlogBundle/Resources/views/layout.html.twig #}

    {# .. #}
    
    {% stylesheets 
        '@BloggerBlogBundle/Resources/public/css/*'
        output='css/blogger.css'
        filter='yui_css'
    %}
        <link href="{{ asset_url }}" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" />
    {% endstylesheets %}

    {# .. #}

Now if you refresh the symblog website and view the files output by Assetic you
will notice they have been minified. While minification is great for production
servers, it can make debugging difficult, especially when JavaScript is
minified. We can disable the minification when running in the ``development``
environment by prefixing the filter with a ``?`` as follows.

.. code-block:: html
    
    {% stylesheets 
        '@BloggerBlogBundle/Resources/public/css/*'
        output='css/blogger.css'
        filter='?yui_css'
    %}
        <link href="{{ asset_url }}" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" />
    {% endstylesheets %}

Dumping the assets for production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In production we can dump the asset files using Assetic so they become actual
resources on disk ready to be served by the web server. The process of creating
the assets through Assetic with every page request can be quite slow,
especially when filters are being applied to the assets. Dumping the assets
for ``production`` ensures that Assetic is not used to serve the assets and instead
the pre-processed asset files are served directly by the web server. Run the following
task to create dump the asset files.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ app/console --env=prod assetic:dump

You will notice a number of CSS files were created at ``web/css`` including the
combined ``blogger.css`` file. Now if you run the symblog website in the ``production``
environment via ``http://symblog.dev/`` the files will be served directly
from this folder.

.. note::

    If you dump the asset files to disk and want to revert back to the
    ``development`` environment, you will need to clean up the created asset
    files in ``web/`` to allow Assetic to recreate them.

Conclusion
----------

We have covered a number of new areas with regards to Symfony2 including
the Symfony2 environments and how to use the Assetic asset library. We also
made improvements to the homepage and added some components to the sidebar.

In the next chapter we will move on to testing. We will explore both unit
and functional testing using PHPUnit. We will see how Symfony2 comes complete
with a number of classes to assist in writing functional tests that simulate
web requests, allow us to populate forms and click links and then inspect the
returned response.
